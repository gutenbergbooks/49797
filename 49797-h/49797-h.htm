<h2>CAKES,
BUNS and PASTRY</h2>


<h3>Angel Cakes and Food.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 qts. Whites.</li>
<li>3½ lbs. Sugar.</li>
<li>1¾ lbs. Flour.</li>
<li>1 oz. Cream of Tartar.</li>
</ul>

<p>If preferred, a little more sugar and a little less flour
may be used. Angel Food is practically the same as Angel
Cake. Do not grease pans, but dip in water before filling.
Turn upside down as soon as taking from the oven. Ice cake
as desired.</p>


<h3>Alberts.</h3>

<p>Four lbs. flour, 2 lbs. sugar, 14 oz. butter and lard, 8
eggs, ½ oz. ammonia and a little lemon oil. Break and rub
the butter and lard into the flour so as to incorporate it well.
Make a tray, and place sugar in it, the eggs next, and the
ammonia and oil of lemon. Beat the eggs a little with the
hand so as to mix well the ammonia and oil of lemon. Work
all together and shake up until thoroughly mixed; next
break into small pieces and roll into balls, and when all are
finished place them 1½ inches apart in pans without grease.</p>

<p>Then with a rounded point cone made for the purpose,
press in the center of each, so that they will break open in
three or four places around the sides, and bake in a tolerably
warm oven.</p>


<h3>Bolivars.<br />

<span class="subtitle">See recipe for <a href="#Molasses_Cakes">Molasses Cakes</a>.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<h3>Cup Cakes.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. Sugar.</li>
<li>1½ lbs. Butter.</li>
<li>18 Eggs.</li>
<li>1½ oz. Soda.</li>
<li>3 oz. Cream of Tartar.</li>
<li>1½ qts. Milk.</li>
<li>6 lbs. Flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Proceed same as ordinary fancy or drop cake. Bake in
hot oven.</p>


<h3>Cocoanut Cakes.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ lbs. Sugar.</li>
<li>3 oz. Butter.</li>
<li>¾ lb. Flour.</li>
<li>¼ oz. Cream of Tartar.</li>
<li>3 lbs. grated Cocoanut.</li>
<li>Egg Yolks.</li>
<li>Flavor (usually Lemon).</li>
</ul>

<p>Use enough of the egg yolks to make a medium stiff
dough and bake in a hot oven.</p>


<h3>Currant Cake, No. 1.</h3>

<p>Two pounds of sugar, 1 pound of lard, 12 eggs, 2 quarts
of milk, 1 ounce of soda, 2 pounds of small currants, 3½
pounds of strong cake flour, 2 ounces cream of tartar, flavor
with strawberry.</p>

<p>Take the sugar and lard, rub to a cream, add the eggs,
next add the milk. Dissolve soda in the milk, put the currants
in, mix all together, take your sieve, put over the bowl. Put
the flour and cream of tartar in sieve and sieve through,
mix light. Bake in small cup cake pans, grease light. These
cakes you do not ice. Sell for one cent each, or six for five
cents. Bake in heat of 550 degrees F.</p>


<h3>Currant Cake, No. 2.<br />
<span class="subtitle">Small Mixture.</span></h3>

<p>Three-quarters pound sugar, ¾ pound lard, 5 eggs, ½
pint milk, ½ pound currants, ½ ounce soda, 2½ pounds flour,
1 ounce cream tartar.</p>

<p>This cake is mixed and baked the same as Currant Cake
No. 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<h3>Cheese Cake.</h3>

<p>Two lbs. of cheese passed through a sieve. Put in a bowl
and add half a pound of powdered sugar, 4 eggs, 3 oz. of
butter and 2 oz. of cornstarch or 4 oz. of flour mixed well
together; flavor with cinnamon, lemon, vanilla or mace.
Vanilla and lemon may be used together. The mixture
should be of a running order, adding sufficient milk to become
so. Cheese cake, when baked, should have the appearance
of custard, it should be nice and smooth when cut.
Cheese cake can be altered or cheapened to suit prices and
trade. Less butter and eggs may be used and a proportionately
large amount of cornstarch or flour and milk
added.</p>

<p>Care should be taken in selecting a good cheese for this
cake. Hard, sandy and dry cheese is as good as useless, for
you never get the “grit” out of it, and it will absorb the milk
or moisture. All cheese cakes when baked are sprinkled
over with powdered sugar.</p>


<h3>Cup Cake, No. 1.</h3>

<p>Two and one-half pounds of sugar, 1½ pounds lard or
butter, 15 eggs, 1 quart milk, 1 ounce soda, 4½ pounds flour,

<p>Take sugar and lard, rub to a cream. Next add the eggs,
mix. Take the milk. Dissolve the soda in the milk, mix together.
Take your sieve, put over the bowl. Put your flour
in and cream of tartar. Sieve through, mix and bake in heat
of 500 degrees F. These cakes are baked in large lunch
cake pans. When baked and cooled, ice with vanilla and
chocolate, and sell at two cents each, or three for five cents.</p>


<h3>Cup Cake, No. 2.<br />
<span class="subtitle">Small Mixture.</span></h3>

<p>One pound sugar, ½ pound lard or butter, 7 eggs, 1
quart milk, ½ ounce soda, 2 pounds flour, 1 ounce cream of
tartar, flavor with vanilla.</p>

<p>This mixture is made and baked in the same way as
Cup Cake No. 1, only difference is, no icing. Put, say, about
ten or twelve currants in each pan and bake in same heat
as Cup Cake No. 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<h2>POUND CAKE FOR WHOLESALE.</h2>


<p>The development of the pound cake business in America
during the last five years has been rapid. Especially is this
true of the East. New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore
have all consumed large quantities, while the western
cities have not been as large consumers. The reason for
the latter, I believe, is because in most cases those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
have been pushing the business have tried to sell their goods
too cheap or have gone to the other extreme and charged
prices out of reach of the general purchasing public as an
everyday commodity. Those who have charged the higher
price have made more of a success than those who tried to
sell too cheap. Hence I shall treat this matter from a standpoint
of high class goods.</p>

<p>In the first place I will consider the method of manufacture,
and the first thing to be considered is the method
of creaming.</p>


<h3>Method of Creaming.</h3>

<p>The creaming of butter is the most essential feature
of the cake business. A large number of bakers fail in this
important point. Hard, lumpy butter and soft, oily compound,
or lard, are thrown together into the machine; then
the sugar is thrown in regardless of the lumps it may contain,
and then the maker expects a fine smooth eating cake.
This is a great mistake, as from such mixing satisfactory
results cannot be obtained. Where two or more substances
are being mixed together they should be of the same degree
of toughness, as near as possible.</p>

<p>Where it is desired to cream up a hard butter and a
soft greasy butter or oily compound, the hard one should
be worked either by the hand or the machine and made
pliable, and the soft one should be put in the ice box to
harden. When butter, or butter and lard or compound is
being used, they should be of the same consistence as near
as possible.</p>

<p>The speed of the machine is also an important factor.
About 150 revolutions a minute is a safe speed. Under no
circumstance should a hard wiry or brittle butter be used.
If used at all, it should be well worked with the machine
before adding the sugar. In fact, it is a good plan to let
the machine revolve a number of times with the butter alone,
then add half of the sugar, which should be previously sifted
through a fine sieve. When this has been well worked, add
the balance of the sugar, extracts, or spice, and if you are
using a coloring, this should now be put in.</p>

<p>Let the machine run from five to ten minutes, according
to the weather. In hot weather your materials all being
hot the butter would gather heat and possibly cause your
mixture to curdle. See that the mixture is scraped down
in the machine thoroughly; then start machine again, adding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the eggs a few at a time. When the eggs are all added, flour
should be lightly mixed in, but never before it has been
thoroughly sifted, as this is one of the greatest mistakes
possible to make—to use flour that has not been incorporated
with the air before mixing. When you are using glycerine,
this should have been well worked up and added when a
portion of the flour has been worked in, although if your
butter is strong enough it is better to work the glycerine in
when sugar is being mixed, but if your butter is any way
soft this should not be done. In using glycerine too large
quantities should not be used. The same is true of glucose,
which if used in small quantities is an advantage, but when
too large quantities are used most disastrous results are obtained.
The judicious use of some of these articles are the
roads between success and failure. It must not be supposed
that these articles are used in all kinds of cakes, but in certain
kinds of cakes they are the needed help, and are not
used merely for the purpose of cheapening the cost, but to
improve the quality.</p>

<p>A cake to sell well must have flavor, texture and grain,
and neither of these can be obtained from an imperfect
mixture, or one that is imperfectly made. In using eggs,
great care should be used in their selection, as when the
prices are high and eggs scarce, these are the times when
large quantities of cake are usually sold. Therefore, in figuring
the cost of your cake, don’t do it in June, when everything
is naturally cheap. June and December do not work
in harmony together, as a rule, and if you are basing your
profits on June prices to sell in the spring months, when
everything is high, you will have to readjust matters. With
proper management, however, and carefully considering these
matters, it will be possible to make a good cake at a popular
price.</p>

<p>In baking your cakes the pans should be covered similar
to a sandwich pan. If you have no pans suitably covered,
the pans can be covered with thick brown paper or thin
wood—anything to keep the top heat of the oven from browning
the cake too much, as the sale of your cake will depend
to a great extent upon the delicate appearance of it. When
we state that these cakes are better if kept a few weeks
before being sold, this possibly would seem strange to many
of our readers; nevertheless, it is a fact that if this class of
cake is properly made and properly baked, age up to a limited
time will be the determining factor in its quality.</p>

<p>But it must be borne in mind that the storage of the
cakes after being baked, or as soon as being removed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the oven, will have much to do with the future keeping qualities
of the cake. It is a mistake to turn the cake out on
the iron pans or on wooden shelves and allow them to remain
there with the steam from the baking being kept in
them, as you must recollect that the paper around the pans
which in the baking has adhered to the cake has become
thoroughly saturated with grease and has consequently practically
formed an air-proof surface. Therefore the steam
has very little chance of escaping readily, and in order to
get the best from this class of cakes they should cool off
readily, and as soon as they are thoroughly cooled should at
once be wrapped in an air-proof paper and stored on shelves,
with sufficient space between all sides for a circulation of air
between each cake. Your shelves also should be formed
from slats, or if made from solid wood should have two
such slats running longways, in order that the air can get
under as well as all around them. If placed flat on the
shelves, the possibilities of moulding in hot weather is
greater. I think now, that I have given pretty thorough instructions,
on a general principle. Of course, there will
have to be instructions given occasionally in the various
cakes that I will describe, but if the instructions which I
have given here are carried out, the others will be mere
matters of small importance.</p>

<p>There is one thing here that I will speak of, and that is
in the formula in which I give milk in: I meant you to be
careful to see that in hot weather there is no chance of the
milk being sour—or in fact at any time, although in hot
weather the danger is much greater, both from the milk
souring quicker and also from the fact that the cake is more
readily to form a bacterial growth of a vicious ferment.</p>

<p>In some of the cakes that I describe I shall mention
baking powder. This will always mean cream of tartar, soda,
or corn starch mixed in the proportions that I shall give
later on. Under no conditions should the common phosphate
baking powder be used, although in some cheap small
cakes these are to be preferred, but where it is necessary
to use the cheap ones I will mention it. I contemplate giving
quite a number of cakes of different forms and flavors,
and whilst this may seem unnecessary yet it may be helpful
to some of our friends in various parts of the world. I will
now proceed to give two formulas and will continue next
month on same subject.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>56 pounds good white soft winter wheat flour,</li>
<li>36 pounds good tough waxy butter,</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>1½ pounds pure glycerine,</li>
<li>46 pounds standard powdered sugar (46 pound),</li>
<li>14 quarts good fresh eggs,</li>
<li>2 quarts fresh sweet milk (not skim),</li>
<li>1 ounce ground mace,</li>
<li>3 ounces good vanilla extract,</li>
<li>4 ounces baking powder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Place the sugar and butter into the mixer, letting it revolve
slowly. As it gradually creams up, add the glycerine.
Add the eggs, gradually, about a quart at a time. If the butter
shows a tendency to curdle, add a few handfuls of flour.
When the eggs are all in, add the milk; sift the baking powder
and spices into the flour, and add to the mixture. Then
mix lightly but thoroughly.</p>

<p>Here is a cheaper cake, but one which is really a nice
cake, and one that will sell well almost anywhere:</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>15 pounds good butter,</li>
<li>8 pounds cottolene and compound,</li>
<li>33 pounds standard powdered sugar,</li>
<li>54 pounds soft white winter wheat flour,</li>
<li>12 ounces baking powder,</li>
<li>8 quarts eggs,</li>
<li>1½ pounds glycerine,</li>
<li>Extract vanilla or lemon,</li>
<li>2 ounces ground mace,</li>
<li>5½ quarts milk,</li>
</ul>

<p>A little egg coloring used in your milk to make it the
desired color would help the appearance of the cake.</p>

<p>Cream up this, as in the preceding mixture, but as soon
as the mixture is thoroughly mixed, place into the pans.
The least handling after the cake is mixed the better, as
there is quite a little powder used here, and you do not want
it to work before going into the oven.</p>

<p>I will now give the baking powder formula. Remember
that the baking powder described here should be made at
least three or four days before using, keeping it covered in an
air-tight can. The reason it should be blended together is
to avoid its hasty working when freshly mixed in the cakes:</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 Pounds soda,</li>
<li>7 pounds cream tartar,</li>
<li>3 pounds corn starch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all together and pass through a sieve several times,
and then put into a can for storage. In using it, always sift
it through a fine sieve with the flour.</p>

<h2>A FEW HINTS ON CAKE
MAKING</h2>


<h3>Flour for Cake Making.</h3>

<p>In order to secure the best results in cake baking the
subject of Flour must be studied very carefully.</p>

<p>For cake baking Winter Wheat flour, of course, is used.
Unfortunately, there is no regular standard for Winter Wheat
flour, hence the baker is constantly confronted with the
necessity of solving many problems as to how to secure the
best results with different brands, some being soft
and others strong, tough, etc., all requiring a little different
treatment. No “Fancy Straight” or “Patent Winter” flour,
according to present standards, are the same, hence it is impossible
to give “standard” recipes in cake making. The
best recipe ever devised will not be successful in every case.
Bakers frequently condemn good recipes because they cannot
get good results, not considering that there may be a
great difference in the materials that they are using.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to a standard formula are recipes
such as sponge cakes, composed of 1 lb. of Sugar, 1 lb. of
Eggs, 1 lb. of flour; or pound cake, made of 1 lb. of Sugar,
1 lb. of Butter, a pound of Eggs and a pound of Flour; doughnuts,
where 4 lbs. of Flour are used to the quart of Milk, etc.</p>

<p>However, for the reason that every time we get flour the
flour is different, the baker must change the recipe to conform
with this difference in the flour.</p>

<p>The most benefit, however, would be derived in knowing
the necessary amount of milk to use, thereby obtaining that
which is most important and necessary in successful cake
making.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>There would be a help, also, in regard to the proper
amount of mixing. For instance, if too strong a flour is used
more milk or water must be added. The result is the mix is
toughened, not only by the strong flour, but by destroying
air cells, which are formed by beating the eggs, creaming
the butter and sugar, and by the baking powder used.</p>


<h3>Sugar.</h3>

<p>Sugar is, next to flour, used most extensively in cake
making. Standard powdered sugar is familiar to every baker.
For a fine powder order XXXX, and a coarser one, fruit or
a coarse powdered—also called non-caking powder. This
sugar is the best to use for most purposes, as it will cream
up easily with butter or with butter and lard. It is much
better than standard powder to use for meringue, as it will
mix more readily and therefore avoid a tendency of the
meringues to get smeary, as is often the case when fine powder
is used, which often contains starch. By the necessary
sifting it needs, flour and other injurious matters are often
mixed in. Although this is the best sugar for cake bakers to
use, it is known to but very few bakers. It will not cake like
standard powdered, and therefore does away with the annoyance
of sifting lumpy standard powdered and saves time and
waste of sugar. Light “C” and “A” sugar is sometimes good
and profitable to use in cakes, as it imparts a nice color and
bloom to the cakes and has a tendency to keep them moister
and fresher.</p>


<h3>Butter.</h3>

<p>Butter is perhaps the most expensive material used in
cake making. Many bakers use cheap butter, it sometimes
being even rancid—fishy. It is unwise to use this class of
butter, for the cakes will surely tell it in the taste. If the
price of butter is high, it is better (in order to reduce the
cost of the making of the cake) to use good butter and lard,
cottolene, or some other similar compound with it. A very
good way is to mix a two weeks’ supply of butter and lard
together, first leaving the butter in a warm room for a day
or so, so that it will have the stiffness of the lard and will
then mix easier and evenly with it. This seems to help keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the butter sweet and saves lots of time and weighing of butter
and lard separately, and it is just the right firmness for
creaming, and avoids the lumps which are often hard to rub
smooth with the sugar while creaming in winter. It also
helps to keep the butter firm and from getting too soft in
summer when a stiff compound is mixed with it. It also
saves money, as the proportion of butter and lard can be
changed as butter gets cheaper or dearer. Sixty pounds of
butter to 100 pounds of lard is frequently used. When butter
is cheaper, use 75 to 100 pounds, and this can be changed to
meet the class of goods turned out in the different bakeries.</p>


<h3>Eggs.</h3>

<p>Eggs have tried to be replaced by more substitutes than
any other ingredient used in cake making. The first thing
to consider in an egg substitute is, does it beat up well, as for
sponge cakes? You cannot beat up or use many substitutes
for sponge cake; but you can use them for anything else.
However, half the quantity of eggs regularly used will often
make a better cake than you can buy, using egg substitutes.</p>

<p>Eggs are often wasted, more being used than necessary,
and where they are of no benefit. It is poor policy to buy
cheap eggs, as they are dear compared to good ones, considering
the little difference in price, sometimes being only two
or three cents a dozen, which makes them dearer in the end
than good eggs.</p>

<p>Eggs known as “Spots” among bakers are not only entirely
worthless but often spoil a cake.</p>

<h2>ONE DOUGH FOR MANY CAKES</h2>

<p>The following relative to making as large a variety of
cakes from one dough as is possible, without, however, having
the cakes appear too much alike, and also have them taste
different, by F. Bauer, of Chicago, should prove of great
value to the general cake baker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>A good many bakers make the mistake of flavoring almost
every cake alike, using lemon and mace or some other
similar favorite spice or extract, giving them that monotonous
bakers’ taste. When more than one kind of cake is made
from one mix, it saves the time for weighing and mixing,
eliminates to some extent the chances of making mistakes,
as it is hard to weigh small amounts of soda, baking powder
and ammonia on the bake shop scale; and a little too much
of either in a small mix is apt to spoil it, while it would hardly
affect a large one. For this very reason many bakers who are
not careful and who do not think it necessary to be accurate
find it hard to work in small shops or in a bakery where small
mixes are made.</p>

<p>Cakes called Butter Rings and “SS” form a good example
of the varieties of cakes that can be made from one mix,
although a larger, smaller or better variety can be made from
others. The Rings and “SS” can be made plain, some strewn
with almonds, some with shredded cocoanut, some left plain
and iced after baking, by melting the required amount of
chocolate and adding to it a part of the dough, Chocolate
Rings and “SS” can be made.</p>

<p>Small cookies like Butter Wafers, Almond Wafers strewn
with almonds, can be made, also small fancy shaped cookies
like “SS,” Hearts, Crescents, Rings and Ovals, decorated
with cherries and angelica, can be made at Christmas time,
and on other occasions, or regularly in better or fancy
bakeries.</p>

<p>One mix or dough from which can be derived a large
benefit and satisfaction is the ordinary wine cake or layer
cake mix, from which you can make layers for layer cakes,
ten and five cent wine cakes, loaf cakes; adding chopped nuts
and nut flavor to part of the mix, you can make nut cakes.
By adding melted chocolate to a certain part of the mix, you
can make devil’s food cakes, lemon cakes, Boston squares,
chocolate and maple squares, raspberry and chocolate drops,
cup and currant cakes, and other cakes like nut and cocoanut
slices, penny golden-rod squares, etc., can also be made. All
these can be flavored and iced so that hardly any customer
would even imagine that they were made from one and the
same dough. This way of making cakes enables one to make
larger mixes, make smaller amounts of each cake so they
can be made fresh oftener, and keep a larger variety of cakes
in store. On Mondays or other busy days, or when you want
to get off a day or so, or being short of help, one can make a
large assortment of cakes in a short time.</p>

<h2>GENERAL RULES.<br />

<span class="subtitle">BY J. E. WIHLFAHRT.</span></h2>


<p>In making cakes, after the proper selection of ingredients,
the respective quantity to be used is of great importance; and
the binding material, or the ingredient which binds the different
materials into the solid mass, when they come into contact with
the heat during the process of baking cakes, deserves first attention.
Flour, of course, ranks as the principal binding material
and practically is the cheapest material, used in bulk, with
which the cake-baker has to deal, and is the one that, by its
judicious use, will cheapen or otherwise increase the cost of
manufacture.</p>

<p>This is due to the fact that a cake mixture, generally speaking,
should be held as soft as possible, as a stiffer mixture would
require additional ingredients in order to make the product of
the same standard quality, and as flour usually is the cheaper
ingredient, then it follows that a stiffer mixture would either
decrease the quality of the product or increase the cost of manufacture.
Thus the various ingredients principally used in the
manufacture of cakes are proportioned in the following way as
to their binding qualities in a cake mixture:</p>

<p>Taking as a basis a “pound cake mixture” consisting of one
pound each of sugar, shortening, eggs and flour, and it would be
desirable to cheapen this mixture by adding, say, milk and flour,
it would be necessary to add the milk and flour in even proportions,
and for each two ounces of milk and flour so added
one-sixteenth of an ounce of baking powder would be required
additionally, or in its place a proportioned amount of soda bicarbonate
and cream of tartar, which, in this case, would be one
sixty-fourth of an ounce of the former and one thirty-second of
an ounce of the latter.</p>

<p>Should we continue to add flour and milk and repeat the
aforesaid amount eight times, we arrive at a cake mixture calling
for one pound each of sugar, shortening and eggs, but one
pint of milk, two pounds flour and one-half ounce of baking
powder, or an equivalent amount of soda bicarbonate with cream
of tartar.</p>

<p>Should we further desire to reduce the cost of manufacture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in purpose not only to reduce the selling price, but also to increase
the volume of expansion to a given weight of such cake,
we reduce one egg and, correspondingly, two ounces of shortening,
and this necessitates to again increase the amount of
baking powder one-sixteenth of an ounce for each egg and two
ounces of shortening so reduced from the original recipe, which
in this case again would be the pound cake mixture.</p>

<p>If we follow by reducing this amount four times, we have
a recipe calling for one pound sugar, one-half pound shortening,
four eggs, one pint milk, two pounds flour and one ounce baking
powder, or a recipe which is the general basis for loaf cake
mixture.</p>

<p>This intimates that one ounce of flour has the binding quality
for one ounce of milk, if added to a mixture. Again, one
egg will correspond in binding quality to two ounces of shortening;
that is, one egg, (figuring the average weight of eggs as
two ounces each) would correspond to two ounces of milk in
binding power, and flour would find its own weight in shortening,
and as one egg has the binding quality of two ounces of
flour, we may add one egg, and reduce the corresponding amount
of flour, which, by producing a softer mixture, increases the
quality of the product at the minimum cost of manufacture.</p>

<p>Shortening, in general, (by which I refer to butter, lard,
oils or vegetable fats) and eggs have the tendency, when properly
incorporated in a mixture, to lighten the cakes, that is why
they are creamed together with the sugar, but the same as sugar
itself, they have a shortening effect to enrich the cake.</p>

<p>In yeast-raised cakes the binding quality of the different
ingredients vary, and one egg, for instance, only possesses the
binding quality for one and one-half ounces of corresponding
material; but, on the other side, the flour will absorb and retain
a good deal more moisture for the reason that for yeast-raised
cakes stronger flour is used than for cakes made by the use of
baking powders, and again during the process of fermentation
the gluten is developed, whereas in baking powder goods the
gluten in flour is of no value.</p>

<p>It is needless to repeat here that baking powder and allied
products are of entirely different nature and quality, and the
comparison is not made with intention to substitute one leavening
agent for the other.</p>

<p>Baking powders, ammonia carbonate, soda bicarbonate, cream
of tartar, etc., do not add to the nutritious quality of a cake,
but their use is tolerated by reason of their great convenience,
and, furthermore, they are an absolute necessity for a certain
class of cakes, but in all cases good judgment should be exercised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to use the least possible quantities that will produce the
necessary lightness or neutralize the presence of acidity.</p>

<p>The amount of soda bicarbonate to be used, especially for
molasses goods, often depends upon the water, and while the
latter is little used in the manufacture of cakes, it is well to
state that soft water requires less soda than if hard water is to
be used. Hard water may be softened by the addition of a solution
of soda bicarbonate.</p>

<p>Sodium chloride, generally called common salt, is very rarely
used in the manufacture of cakes, unless for molasses goods,
etc., where the addition of a minute amount exerts a beneficial
influence on the binding material employed; it also acts, in part,
to neutralize the acidity of molasses, which usually is contained
in the latter in overabundant quantities, and, therefore, does not
interfere with the action of the soda bicarbonate. The principal
reason for using a small amount of salt is that it will stimulate
the capacity of the palate to recognize the flavor of the finished
product to better advantage.</p>

<p>Sodium bicarbonate, commonly called baking soda, is used
to spread and lighten the cakes, as well as for its neutralizing
power, as in contact with acids it develops carbonic acid gas,
thus leavening the cakes.</p>

<p>Ammonia carbonate is the strongest of this class of leavenings
known in the manufacture of cakes, but leaves a displeasing
flavor and coarse grain if used in too large quantities; employed
in part with soda bicarbonate it usually gives very satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>If by error too much soda bicarbonate is used, the product
will have a greenish tint and bitter taste. If such error occurs,
it is well to add a proportion of cream of tartar or tartaric acid
to neutralize the over-amount of soda and allow the mixture to
rest sufficient time so one may neutralize the other.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to refer to the flour, as every one
connected with the baking business knows that soft flour is used
for cakes—one containing the least gluten, and consists usually
of the soft white winter wheat class. While winter wheat flour
often can be bought at a lower price than spring wheat flour,
it is not the reason for its use in cakes, but because it is better
adapted.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>


<p>Cleanliness IS godliness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Always knead butter and lard before using.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Avoid flash heat in baking unless conditions require it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ten whole eggs or 18 whites or 25 yolks equal one
pint.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Remember butter and sugar require a great deal of
rubbing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When using some lard in place of butter entirely, use
half lard and half butter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fresh eggs placed in cold water will immediately sink,
while bad ones will float on top.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few drops of lemon juice is a great help when beating
egg whites, making them come up quickly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cotton-seed oil may be substituted for lard in all cases.
It is richer than lard, hence a less quantity must be used.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In beating mixtures do not start too fast. A slow
circular motion at first gradually increasing speed gives the
best results.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When heating an oven half an hour or more should be
allowed to elapse after proper temperature is reached before
baking is started.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No baker can hope to make perfect goods who does
not accurately weigh and measure all materials. Guess work
keeps many bakers poor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A simple test for molasses is to mix a small quantity of
soda with it. If it foams and has a sweet odor it is good,
otherwise it is not fit for baking purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Copper utensils should be used with extreme care.
When liquids, etc., are allowed to stand in them after cooking
poisonous chemical action takes place that is dangerous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When beating it should be remembered that it is absolutely
necessary to keep your tools free of grease or other
substances. It is important to beat steadily, frequently
changing hands to vary motion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To test the heat of an oven throw a little corn meal
in the center, and if it begins to smoke in 30 or 40 seconds
the oven is ready for baking, the proper heat being about
550 degrees Fahrenheit. The dampers should be closed when
it reaches this point.</p>

<p>In creaming always rub steadily, adding the eggs very
gradually.</p>


<h3>Self-Raising Flour.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>45 lbs. Flour.</li>
<li>15 oz. Soda.</li>
<li>10½ oz. Tartaric Acid.</li>
</ul>

<p>A formula when ammonia is used is as follows: 2¼ lbs.
Sugar, ¾ lb. Butter; ½ oz. Ammonia, ¼ oz. Soda, ½ oz.
Cream of Tartar, 3 pints Milk, 9 Eggs, 6¾ lbs. Flour. Many
omit the soda and cream of tartar entirely, using only ammonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>


<h3>Cream Cakes.<br />
<span class="subtitle">See recipe for <a href="#Eclairs">Eclairs</a>.</span></h3>


<h3>Cream Rolls.</h3>

<p>Use ordinary puff paste a little over ⅛ in. thick, cut into
pieces of proper width and wash. Make hollow rolls around
stick or conical tin tubes. Coat slightly with granulated sugar
and bake before removing sticks or tubes. Fill with creams or
meringue from bag.</p>


<h3>Cream Puffs.</h3>

<p>Seal in 1 qt. water to which 1¼ lbs. lard has been added,
1½ lbs. spring wheat flour. Let it work out well.</p>

<p>Then add about 25 eggs, a few at a time. Judgment
must be used to get the right stiffness.</p>

<p>Drop them in a dusted pan with either bag or by hand
and bake in a fairly warm oven.</p>


<h3>Cocoanut Kisses.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. Sugar.</li>
<li>1 qt. Egg Whites.</li>

<p>Add sugar after eggs are beaten up firm. Make kisses in
rings through star tube. Bake cool in dusted pans. Cover
with dessicated cocoanut.</p>


<h3>Currant Diamonds.</h3>

<p>Two and a half lbs. flour, 1 lb. sugar, 1 lb. butter or lard,
2 eggs, ½ pint milk, ½ oz. ammonia, 4 oz. currants. Rub
butter, sugar and eggs light; then add the currants; then the
ammonia dissolved in the milk, and lastly the flour. Roll the
dough out and cut with a fluted diamond-shaped cutter.
Wash them off with milk, place on greased pans, and bake in
a quick oven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<h3>Cinnamon Drops.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. Sugar.</li>
<li>9 oz. Butter.</li>
<li>1½ pts. Molasses.</li>
<li>1½ pts. Water.</li>
<li>6 Eggs.</li>
<li>¾ oz. Soda.</li>

<li>3¾ lbs. Flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bake in a medium oven. Drop mixture on well greased
pans with spoon.</p>


<h3>Poor Man’s Bread.</h3>

<p>Whip 1 quart and ½ pint of egg whites fairly stiff, then
beat into it 5¼ pounds xxxx powdered sugar; flavor with
vanilla and darken with burnt sugar color, and finally add
3½ of flour and mix until the mass is a little sunny. Fill
into oval shallow pans that have been greased and dusted
with flour. Allow them to dry until a crust has formed on
top, then bake in a medium oven. When cold knock out of
pans, not before.</p>


<h3>Cocoanut Kisses.</h3>

<p>In a bright kettle put 1 pound finely grated cocoanut,
1½ pounds powdered sugar and sufficient white of eggs to
make a medium soft mass. Place on fire and heat until
unable to bear the finger in it any longer, stirring constantly.
Take off fire and let cool. Then add 4 ounces of
stale pound cake crumbs and 4 ounces of flour and sufficient
white of egg until the mass can be handled with bag and
tube. Then lay them out on greased and dusted sheet pans
like almond macaroons. Care must be taken when heating;
use only pound cake crumbs, and do not let them stand and
become crusted or they will not crack nicely.</p>


<h3>Charlotte Russe.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 oz. Gelatine.</li>
<li>1 lb. Sugar.</li>
<li>2 qts. Cream.</li>
<li>Vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>First dissolve gelatine, then beat up the cream well. Add
the sugar, gelatine and flavor. Mix very lightly and fill in the
regular cup made of sponge cake mixture. Less sugar may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
be used if desired. To the above may also be added 20 Whites
of Eggs to make a different mixture. Another recipe using
egg yolks which is quite popular is as follows: 2 oz. Gelatine,
8 Egg Yolks, 1 lb. Sugar (powdered), 1 qt. milk, 2 qts. heavy
cream. First soften the gelatine in cold water. After the
yolks are thoroughly beaten add sugar and milk, stirring in
the gelatine. Heat, but don’t boil, stirring to keep smooth,
then beat in the whipped cream and allow to cool.</p>


<h3><a id="Corn_Muffins"></a>Corn Muffins.</h3>

<p>One and one-half pounds sugar, ½ pound lard or butter,
9 eggs, 1 quart milk, ⅔ ounce soda, 1 pound corn meal, 2
pounds flour, 1⅓ ounces of cream of tartar, flavor lemon.</p>

<p>Take sugar and lard, rub to a cream, add the eggs, rub
good. Now take the milk, dissolve the soda in the milk and
mix. Take your sieve, put over the bowl, put the corn meal,
cream of tartar and flour together, sieve through. Mix and
bake in heat of 550 degrees F. Bake in cup cake pans,
greased light. No icing. These cakes sell for one cent each,
or six for five cents.</p>


<h3>Corn Muffins, No. 2.<br />
<span class="subtitle">Small Mixture.</span></h3>

<p>Three-quarters pound sugar, ¼ pound lard or butter, 3
eggs, 1 pint milk, ⅓ ounce soda, ¼ pound corn meal, ¾
pound flour, 1 ounce cream of tartar, flavor with lemon.</p>

<p>This mixture is mixed, greased and baked as Corn Muffin
No. 1. Sold for one cent each, six for five cents.</p>


<h3>Doughnuts.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 qts. Water.</li>
<li>6 qts. Milk.</li>
<li>6 oz. Soda.</li>
<li>12 oz. Cream of Tartar.</li>
<li>1½ lbs. Lard.</li>
<li>7½ lbs. Sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Add to the above sufficient flour to make a good stiff
dough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>


<h3>French Crullers</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 lb. Butter.</li>
<li>4 oz. Sugar.</li>
<li>1 qt. Water.</li>
<li>2 lbs. Flour.</li>
<li>28 Eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>A richer cruller can be made as follows: 1 lb. Butter, 4
oz. Sugar, 1¼ pts. Milk, 2½ lbs. Flour, 16 Eggs.</p>


<h3><a id="Eclairs"></a>Eclairs.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. Lard.</li>
<li>3 pts. Water.</li>
<li>35 Eggs.</li>
<li>2 lbs. Spring Wheat Flour.</li>
<li>⅜ oz. Ammonia.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above is used both for cream cakes and all kinds of
eclairs. It is important to remember, however, that the dough
for eclairs must be stiffer than for cream cakes. Before
starting the mixture it is absolutely necessary, if you desire
good results, to have all material properly prepared and ready
for immediate use. Eggs should be broken and ready, likewise
ammonia, pans, etc.</p>

<p>The lard and water should be allowed to boil for a minute
before adding the flour, which must be done very quickly,
stirring thoroughly. In fact everything must be done
quickly if you want perfect goods. Add eggs, about 2 at a
time, and when ready add ammonia. Results depend largely
on having the dough just right, not too thick and not too
thin. Too much ammonia will ruin the batch. Bake in hot
oven.</p>


<h3>Ginger Snaps.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 pts. Molasses.</li>
<li>1½ pts. Water.</li>
<li>3 oz. Soda.</li>
<li>4½ lbs. Sugar.</li>
<li>1½ lbs. Lard.</li>
<li>9¼ lbs. Flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are washed with water before baking. Medium
oven. Some use ammonia and about 1½ lbs. of corn meal.</p>


<h3>Ginger Bread.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 pts. Molasses.</li>
<li>3 pts. Water.</li>
<li>1½ oz Soda.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>1½ oz. Cream of Tartar.</li>
<li>2 lbs. Crumbs.</li>
<li>1 lb. Lard.</li>
<li>6 lbs. Flour.</li>
<li>Spices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have pan well greased. Ice on top. Usually sold in
penny squares. For a better grade use 4 or 5 eggs.</p>


<h3>Ice Cream Cones.</h3>

<p>Eight oz. flour, 4 oz sugar, 1 pint whipped cream, 8
eggs, 1 gill curacoa, pinch of salt, vanilla. These ice cream
cones are made in special irons, which are greased and filled
with the above batter from a handbag. They are baked on
the gas machine. This recipe is for very fine goods, and can
be cheapened considerably.</p>


<h3><a id="Icing"></a>Icing.</h3>

<p>Water Icing is made with ordinary Sugar and Water, colored
and flavored as desired.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ornamental Icing is composed of plain Sugar beat up
well with Egg Whites and a few drops of Lemon Juice. The
usual proportion is to use ¼ lb. sugar to every white of an
egg used.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Icing for cake is usually made thinner than ornamenting
icing. For a cheap icing Gelatine is used in place of the
eggs. Use 2 oz. Gelatine to every pint of water (warm).
Beat up well with the sugar.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chocolate Icing is made with 1 lb. of Chocolate to every
quart of water and the necessary amount of sugar. A cheaper
Chocolate Icing is made with Cocoa and Cocoa Butter.
Boiled Chocolate Icing is made by boiling the chocolate,
sugar and water for about 10 minutes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Transparent Icing is made by boiling Pulverized Sugar
and water together in proportions of about 2 lbs. of Sugar to
each pint of water. When it becomes like rich cream it is
poured hot on the cake top. Care should be taken to rub the
sugar thoroughly against the sides of the vessel while boiling
in order to mix thoroughly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Soft Icing consists of Powdered Sugar sifted very fine
and boiling water and Fruit Juice mixed. Use 1 lb of Sugar
to 2 tablespoonfuls of boiling water and 2 tablespoonfuls of
Fruit Juice. This is colored in any way desired. Spread on
while the cake is warm. This icing is especially good for
sponge cake, etc.</p>

vanilla cream and build up with other sheets. Cover top
with water icing and cut into oblong squares.</p>


<h3>Neapolitan Cake.</h3>

<p>Neapolitan cake is made with regular sponge cake mixture,
differently colored, pink, yellow, chocolate, etc. Bake

<p>These are made with ordinary Sponge Cake. Ice, and
place slice of Orange on top. More yolks or coloring is put
in this cake to give the deep orange color. These goods
may be made up in the form of Diamonds, Crescents, etc.,
jellies or fruits of all kinds may be substituted for the orange.
White squares are made with Lady Cake composed of two
layers, with Vanilla Cream between and icing on top.</p>


<h3>Orange Pastry Tart.</h3>

<p>Roll out a round bottom of good puff paste dough, not
too thin. Wash the edge with egg and place a strip of the
puff paste 1½ inches wide around the edge of the bottom.
Decorate this strip with small stars, hearts, crescents, or
any small fancy cutter you may have, and from the puff
paste wash all with egg and bake well, but take care not to
brown the center too much. As soon as baked ice the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>

<p>Orange Cream for Filling.-½ lb. of sugar, ½ pt. white
wine, 6 yolks, the rind and juice of 1½ oranges, ¾ oz. gelatine
that has been softened in a little warm water, and if
not tart enough add the juice of 1 lemon. Boil this, stirring
constantly until slightly thick; remove from fire, and when
cooled a little add the snow of 4 whites of egg carefully. In
the egg white beat in a handful of sugar to prevent coagulation
when mixing it into the warm cream filling. Finish as
stated above.</p>


<h3>Patty Shells.</h3>

<p>Patty Shells are made with ordinary puff paste. Cut out

<h3>Pumpernickel.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. Stale Cake (powdered).</li>
<li>4 lbs. Sugar.</li>
<li>6 lbs. Flour.</li>
<li>24 Eggs.</li>
<li>½ oz. Ammonia</li>
<li>Spices.</li>
</ul>

<p>These should be washed over with eggs before baking.</p>


<h3>Patties.</h3>

<p>Patties or tarts are made with puff paste rolled thin,
which forms a lining for pans filled with any kind of fruit.
These can be made in endless varieties. A good recipe for the
pastry is as follows: 1½ lbs. Flour, 1½ lbs. Butter (hard), 2
Eggs, 1½ oz. Baking Powder, Salt and Ice Water. Medium
dough, mixed lightly and rolled four or five times at intervals
of about 15 minutes. This can be made very quickly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3>Puff Paste for Patty Shells.</h3>

<p>Mix 1 lb. spring wheat flour, 2 oz. bread dough, 2 oz.
butter, 1 yolk of egg, ½ pint cold water, to a smooth dough.
The more it is worked the better. Let lay a little while to
recover. In the meantime wash 14 oz. of butter in cold
water, press all the water out. Now roll out the dough ¼
inch thick into as perfect square as possible. Place in the
14 oz. of butter formed in a square in the center, turn the
dough over the butter from all sides, roll 1 inch thick and
turn over again, then roll three times more in the same manner,
but give fifteen minutes’ time between each roll. When
rolling the paste always brush off the flour. Cut proper size
and bake in hot oven. If the shells jump too much or topple
over, the dough must be rolled some more.</p>

<p>If too close and not enough spring, it has been rolled too
much. All depends upon the quality of the butter.</p>


<h3>Puff Paste.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ lbs. Flour.</li>
<li>2 Egg Yolks.</li>
<li>¾ pt. Water.</li>

</ul>

<p>This should be rolled at least 4 times, setting aside 15
minutes between each roll.</p>


<h3>Puff Paste.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ pt. Water.</li>
<li>1 lb. Flour.</li>
<li>1 lb. Butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>If desired, a richer mixture is made by adding eggs and
a little rum.</p>


<h3>Pine Apple Tarts.</h3>

<p>While apples are at their best, their use in fine cake
bakeries can be made manifold and very tasty. A few delicacies
in this line are herewith offered:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No. 1.—Half bake a bottom, in a crimped straight flanged
pan or in a tin ring, some fine sugar dough. When cool
spread this with some apricot marmalade, and upon it slices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of apples of as equal size as possible; sprinkle over the slices
some finely cut blanched almonds, a few washed currants,
sugar and cinnamon, and bake until apples are just soft, but
not mushy; then pour over all some very light colored apple
jelly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No. 2.—As above, half bake a bottom of sugar dough.
When cool place apple slices in the bottom and bake them
until soft. Now beat 6 oz. sugar, 6 egg yolks very light, and
add 6 oz. ground stale almond macaroons. Then beat up half
pint heavy cream and add it to the beaten eggs. Pour this
over the apples and again bake it lightly. When cool dust
with sugar or ice with thin vanilla flavored fondant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No. 3.—Bake in deep straight edge pan a bottom of
sugar dough. On a sheet pan bake a net formed by strips
of the sugar dough crossing each other diagonally so as to
form diamond-shaped openings. The net must be the same
size as the bottom, and both should be fairly well baked.
Partially fill the bottom with rice which has been boiled soft
in milk, adding a little vanilla. Upon this rice place apple
slices that have been boiled soft in sugar syrup. Now place
the network over the apples, dust with sugar, and fill out the
diamonds with pale pink colored fondant that have been flavored
with punch extract.</p>

<h2>JAMS AND JELLIES<br />

<span class="subtitle">BY LOUIS STERN</span></h2>


<p>Jellies and jams are used in every bakeshop where cakes
and tarts are baked, such as jelly roll, diamonds and jelly
squares, layer cakes, jelly tarts, etc. No jelly should be put
on cakes or tarts to be baked in the oven, for it will cook
and run all over the cake. It will make the cake look dirty
and will soak into the cake, make it soft and heavy.</p>

<p>Tarts are made by lining small patty pans with puff
paste, rolled out thin and filled with different kinds of jams
or stewed fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, cherries
or peaches.</p>

<p>Bakers that want a cheap tart usually line small patty
pans with puff paste and set away to dry for about one-half
hour and bake in medium oven. When baked they are filled
with jelly.</p>


<h3>Dark Currant Jelly.</h3>

<p>For this recipe $200 was paid to Harry DeLuke, the
French pastry baker, who brought it to America in the year

<p>Take 2 pounds of gelatine. Put on stove with 23 quarts
of water. When the water begins to boil put in 64 pounds
of the best XXXX powdered sugar, ½ ounce of tartaric
acid and 1 pint of currant juice. Let it boil on the stove for
ten minutes. In the meantime get your pails ready. Rub
them on the inside with rum. When the jelly is boiled
enough, pour into the pails. Leave them open for one day,
then take thick paper soaked in rum, put over the top of
jelly and close down tight. You can color this jelly as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
like, make it dark currant jelly, red currant jelly or any
other color you like by using artificial colors. This jelly is
made so good and costs so little that it can be sold at a
profit. It will keep for years.</p>


<h3>Red Currant Jelly.</h3>

<p>Take 2 ounces gelatine. Dissolve in 1 pint cold water,
1 pint rum, 1 quart boiling water, 2 pounds granulated sugar
and two teaspoonfuls of currant juice. Put on stove, let
boil ten minutes and put in pails for use as needed.</p>


<h3>Colebra Cherry Jam.</h3>

<p>Weigh 10 pounds of fine ripe cherries, cleaned from stem
and pit; put into kettle over the fire with 10 pounds of granulated
sugar, 2 ounces corn starch, let boil 20 minutes until
jam begins to thicken. When done store away same as other
jams.</p>


<h3>Peach and Apple Jam.</h3>

<p>Take 5 pounds of apples and 5 pounds of peaches. Cut
good and fine. Put on stove in kettle, with 11 pounds of
granulated sugar. Let boil 10 minutes and add 3 ounces
corn starch, ⅙ ounce tartaric acid. Let boil 10 minutes
more and it will be ready for use. This jam is very good and
is used in all hotels and bakeshops. It is the only genuine
apple and peach jam.</p>


<h3>Raisin Jam.</h3>

<p>Take 8 pounds of raisins, put in kettle on fire, and 7½
pounds granulated sugar. Let boil 20 minutes and add four

<p>Bring 20 pounds of currants to a boil, with 21 pounds
of fine powdered sugar and ½ pound of corn starch. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
boil 25 to 30 minutes. Keep stirring till it thickens. When
done put in glass jars covered tight. This jam will keep
for a year if directions are followed correctly.</p>


<h3>Huckleberry Jam.</h3>

<p>Bring to a boil 18 pounds of huckleberries, 20 pounds
of XXXX powdered sugar, 4 ounces of corn starch. Boil
15 minutes. Keep stirring until thick and when done place

minutes. When done put in wooden pails. Put thick paper
soaked in rum over the jelly. Put away for future use.</p>


<h3>The Original Peach Jelly.</h3>

<p>Take 1½ ounces of gelatine. Dissolve in ¾ pint of cold
water, add 1½ pounds of granulated sugar. Next add ¾
pint of boiling water. Put on stove and let come to a boil
10 minutes. Flavor with ½ pint mashed peaches. Put in
pail and store away.</p>


<h3>Raspberry Jelly.</h3>

<p>Take, say, 6 quarts of ripe raspberries. Put in kettle
over fire so the juice will flow for 15 minutes. Strain through
thin cloth and let stand for five minutes, so it will set. Then
measure the juice. To every pint of juice add 1 pound of
sugar, and to every pound of sugar add ½ ounce corn starch.
Put on stove to boil for 10 minutes.</p>

<h2>BREAD-MAKING<br />

THE TECHNOLOGY OF BREAD-MAKING</h2>


<p>Trades of every description have during recent years
advanced by leaps and bounds toward betterment and
improvement.</p>

<p>Inventions and discoveries of most important nature and
of stupendous results have from time to time amazed the
human mind and thought.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with inventions and mechanical devices
used in the trades are step by step reaching greater perfection,
simplifying and affording more accurate results of attaining
standards of excellence in finished products.</p>

<p>Professor Liebig once said the baking industry is one in
which new methods and inventions would be very difficult
of introduction, and possibly in his time he may have been
right.</p>

<p>The reason therefore may be attributed to the disinclination
of the baker of that time to break away from fixed
habits, partially, as well as lack of interest manifested by
the general public in the production of a commodity so necessary
to human sustenance.</p>

<p>But all this has been changed. During the last twenty
years the progress made in the baking industry in mechanical
contrivances, newer practical method of hydrating
doughs, and as well as the great advance made in the study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of fermentation, have assumed such vast proportions so as to
place this craft on equal footing with any other trade as
regards progressiveness.</p>

<p>The watchword for the future then is “more progress,”
“more convenience,” “more perfection.”</p>

<p>With this idea in mind, these series of talks have been
undertaken, hoping that they may impress the baker as to
his responsibilities, and that they might stimulate in him a
desire to acquire a greater and more detailed knowledge
of the technical points connected with his trade. The bakery
of to-day supplies man with that important foodstuff,
“Bread,” rightfully called “The staff of life.”</p>

<p>What other trade is there in existence that can boast of
any higher ideal than this?</p>

<p>Pre-eminently, then, the desire should be instilled in
every baker to equip himself with the knowledge of how to
bring his product to such a state of perfection so that it will
absolutely measure up to the standard of its title, <i>The Staff
of Life</i>.</p>

<p>There are various branches of baking. Bread, cake,
pastry and cracker baking. In these talks bread and the
materials entering into bread-making only will be discussed.</p>


<h3>Raw Materials for the Bread Baker.</h3>

<p>In the bread baking the principal materials used are flour,
water, yeast, salt, milk, oil, lard, sugar and yeast foods.</p>


<h3>I.—Flour and Milling.</h3>

<p>A. <i>The moisture of flour.</i> Into a glass retort place
some flour, taken at random from the stock on hand. Attach
to the neck of the retort a glass flask, seeing to it that the
connection is airtight (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). Heat the flour over a bunson
burner gently until brown. Moisture will soon show itself,
accumulating at the colder portions of the flask. The neck
of the retort should be kept cool with wet cloths. In this
manner all the water contained in the flour will be found in
the flask.</p>

<p><i>Ordinary dry flour contains from 8 to 18 per cent of moisture,
and averages 13 per cent.</i></p>

<p>B. <i>Gluten contents of flour.</i>—Knead some wheat flour with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
water into a dough. Lay it aside under cover for fifteen
minutes; then place it in a very fine sieve and let a stream of
water flow over it, working the dough all the time, until the
draining becomes clear, which should be retained for further
testing.</p>

<p>There will remain on the sieve a yellowish gray tough
mass.</p>

<p>This is the <i>gluten</i> which imparts strength to the flour.
<i>Good sound wheat flour contains 10 to 12 per cent. of gluten.</i></p>

<p>The gluten of wheat flour swells considerably in water, but
is not soluble.</p>

<p>In the dry state it is horny and brittle.</p>

<p>When moist it soon ferments and quickly putrifies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;"><a id="Fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/image069.jpg" width="512" height="409" alt="still" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>Gluten is classified as an albuminoid, but is not soluble
in either a weak or concentrated acetic acid solution. When
boiled in a soda solution it becomes partially soluble.</p>

<p>On account of this characteristic it is closely allied to
those albuminoids known as fibrin, which is found in large
proportions in animal blood. In contrast to blood-fibrin
gluten may be said to be vegetable-fibrin.</p>

<p>The gluten of wheat flour is not a simple body, therefore
not an element, but is composed of four varieties of
albuminoids: vegetable albumin, vegetable casein, vegetable
fibrin and gluten itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>A marked difference exists in the gluten of rye flour. It
is difficult to wash it out. It forms a sticky gray mass and
is composed of three varieties of albuminoids—vegetable albumin,
vegetable casein and vegetable fibrin. Gluten itself is
missing.</p>

<p>These three varieties of albuminoids are contained in much
greater proportion than in wheat flour, but the total albuminous
matter in both wheat and rye flour are contained in about equal
proportions.</p>

<p>C. <i>The starches of flour.</i> The wash water which has
been preserved from the gluten washing test will at first
appear to be milky, but gradually becomes clarified. On
the bottom of dish the starch which has come away from the
flour with the wash water will be precipitated as a fine white
powder.</p>

<p><i>The proportion of starch in both wheat and rye flour is
almost equal. The average is 64 per cent.</i> Fine or soft flour
contains more starch than hard or coarse flour.</p>

<p><i>Properties of starch.</i> Take a small quantity of the starch
previously obtained from the flour and mix it with water until
just milky. Place a drop of the starch water on a clean
microscopic slide and put a cover glass over it and gently press
it down. In placing the prepared slide under the microscope
the starch cells are seen to be fairly round or slightly oval,
of various sizes <a href="#Fig_2">(Fig. 2</a>). A little off the center a bitum is
observed.</p>

<p>The “bitum” is a sort of nucleus or spot which is the
center around which the concentric rings of starch are
arranged.</p>

<p>If by chance some of the starch properties be resting on
their narrow surface they will appear elongated. Each starch
particle represents a cell. The interior of the cell contains the
starch proper, and is surrounded by an external coating of very
delicate fibrin or cellulose. In old samples of flour the starch
shows cracks and fissures.</p>

<p>The starch of rye flour is but slightly different (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>),
and is difficult to tell it apart from wheat starch. The particles
of sound rye starch are a trifle larger.</p>

<p>The starch of potatoes (<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>) has a peculiar pear-shaped
formation with very distinct bitum and concentric
rings.</p>

<p>The properties of the starches given should enable the
baker or student with the aid of the microscope to detect any
foreign starch which may have been added to flour as an
adulterant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix a little starch with water and divide the mixture
equally in two beakers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_2"></a> <a id="Fig_3"></a> <a id="Fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/image071.jpg" width="600" height="708" alt="Figures 2, 3, and 4 of fermenting yeast" />
</div>



<p>Heat one portion to the boiling point; the starch then
forms with the water, a thick, gelatinous, somewhat semi-clear
liquid. The boiling causes the interior of the cell to swell,
thereby bursting the cellulose envelopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The structure of the starch cell has been completely disrupted.
The starch becomes gelatinized.</p>

<p>In the other beaker after a little while the raw starch
precipitates. It has completely separated itself in its original
form from the water.</p>

<p>Upon stirring the contents of the beaker violently the
starch grains do not lose their original character, but simply
remain suspended for a time in the water.</p>

<p>When baking bread the gelatinization of the starch does
not take place, because the albuminoids of the flour regulated
by the heat envelopes the liberated starch after its cellulose
cavern has become disrupted, and in consequence prohibits
the gelatinization of the starch.</p>

<p>Dilute some of gelatinized starch with water, pour some
of it into a test tube and add a drop of tincture of iodine;
the cold solution will at once turn a deep blue. Heat the
liquid gently to boiling point; the blue coloring will gradually
disappear; upon cooling the liquid it again turns blue.</p>

<p>The action of tincture of iodine at low temperature is
so intensive that the smallest particles of starch contained
in any substance can be detected by its use. By means of
tincture of iodine starch adulteration in compressed yeasts
may be detected.</p>

<p>Water poured on a lump of starch is rapidly absorbed.
Starch is very hygroscopic, that is, absorbs moisture readily,
and furthermore, retains the absorbed moisture tenaciously.
Hence flour will absorb moisture from the atmosphere. A
high percentage of moisture in flour is conducive of putrifying
of the gluten and albumin of the flour, rendering the flour
unfit for use.</p>

<p>Into a small pan, which has been lightly greased, to
prevent sticking, heat while constantly stirring some starch
flour. It will turn brown; that is, it has been converted
into dextrin. Pure dextrin is soluble in water and is largely
used as a substitute for gum arabic. The same conversion
occurs in bread, as the starch in the exterior of the loaf is
changed into dextrin by the high temperature of the oven
and forms the crust of the loaf.</p>

<p><i>Constituents of starch.</i> Starch is composed of the three
elements—Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen. The composition
of starch is the same as sugar. It contains the same
proportions of hydrogen and oxygen as is contained in water,
namely, in proportions of 2-1 (H<sub>2</sub>O). Therefore starch is a
hydrate, and as these water-forming elements are combined
with carbon it is called carbohydrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>To this group of bodies, besides starch, dextrin, all kinds
of sugar and cellulose are classified.</p>

<p>D. <i>Albumen contents of flour.</i> In a flask place 20 oz.
of wheat flour and saturate with 100 oz. of cold water; shake
up vigorously several times during one-half hour. Then let
the flask stand for some time, after which pour the clear
liquid obtained carefully into a filter paper arranged in a
funnel.</p>

<p>This clear filtrate is placed in a beaker and heated in a
water bath to the boiling point. The clear filtrate will become
turbid flocculent. These flakes are caused by a substance
which is soluble in cold water and which evaporates upon
being heated. This substance is albumin. The albumin of
flour is of the same composition as the white of an egg, and
is classified under the albuminoids. Wheat flour contains 1.5
per cent. of albumin.</p>

<p>E. <i>Extractive matter of flour.</i> After concluding above
experiment, filter the coagulated mixture. Place the clear
filtrate in an evaporating dish and drive off the moisture by
placing the dish in a steam bath. After some time the water
will have been driven off, leaving a solid residue in the dish.
This residue contains sugar, dextrin, a gum-like substance,
and a small quantity of mineral salts, principally potassium
phosphate.</p>

<p>Albuminous substances all contain the four elements—carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, a trace of sulphur,
and some contain phosphor.</p>

<p>The difference between these substances and the carbohydrates
is that they contain nitrogen. They have also received
the name proteids, frequently called flesh formers, on
account of their nutritive properties.</p>

<p>Sugar, dextrin and gum carbohydrates that can be extracted
with water.</p>

<p>F. <i>Fat contents of flour.</i> Shake vigorously for some
time 10 ounces of rye or wheat flour with 40 ounces of ether,
to which has been added 40 ounces of pure alcohol. Heat
the mixture gently to 104 degrees F., and fat globules
will be seen on the surface of the fluid. This is the fat contained
in flour. Rye flour contains 2 per cent., wheat flour 1
per cent. of fat.</p>

<p>G. <i>Cellulose in flour.</i> Flour contains more or less fibrin.
In order to separate it from the flour, the extractive matters
of the flour are washed in consecutive order with water,
ether and alcohol, the residue is then boiled in dilute sulphuric
acid. The fibrin obtained is then washed and dried.
In appearance it looks like wood fiber. This substance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
contained also in the gluten and in the envelopes of the starch
cells. It is insoluble in water, dilute acids or alkaline. It is
indigestible and has no value as a food.</p>

<p>H. <i>Ash of flour.</i> Take a little flour and spread it on a
platinum dish and heat over a bunson burner. Continue the
heating until nothing remains but a grayish white powder. This
is the ash or mineral part of the flour.</p>

<p>These mineral substances enter into the flour through absorption
from the earth by the roots of the wheat grass.</p>

<p>The ash of flour is mostly composed of phosphates, and
are of great importance because they are bone-forming and
help to build up the framework of the human body.</p>


<h3>The Average of Analysis.</h3>

<p>Separating the various constituents of flour is called the
analyzation of flour. If in a different quantity of flour the
amount of each component part is determined it is called quantitative
analysis. The total amount of all constituents is always
figured at 100, in order to give percentage of each constituent
contained. Wheat flour contains 13.37 per cent. of water. It
means that 100 oz. of flour contains 13.37 per cent. of water.
Therefore 100 lbs. of flour contains 13.37 lbs. of water. The
same applies to the starch item, 100 oz. of flour contains 69.30
per cent. of starch.</p>

<p>The total amount of each constituent of several analyses
added together, divided by the sum total of the analyses made,
will give the average amount of each constituent contained in
the flour. These analyses must be made very accurate in order
that the results obtained may be reliable.</p>

<p>The following table, according to R. von Wagner, gives
averages, subdividing the albuminoids into albumen, gliadin,
vegetable casein, cellulose and gluten:</p>

<h2>YEAST AND FERMENTS</h2>


<p>Mix some flour into a dough and bake it. The result will
be a coarse, tough, indigestible cracker.</p>

<p>The flour and water product possesses keeping qualities,
but can only be used as a food when soaked in a fluid.</p>

<p>A baked product if used as a nutriment must possess lightness
and porosity and be so constituted that it can be easily
digested.</p>

<p>For this reason yeast is required in bread making.</p>


<h3>Yeast.</h3>

<p><i>A Gas Test.</i>—Dissolve in a flask 2 ounces of syrup or
honey in a pint of water at 140 degrees F., and add one-sixth
of an ounce of compressed yeast, which has been broken
up and dissolved in a part of the saccharine infusion. Seal
the flask with a perforated rubber cork, pass a bent glass tube
through the perforation and attach a piece of rubber hose
to the glass tubing. In fifteen or twenty minutes small
bubbles will be seen rising to the surface of the fluid, which
will continually increase in number, until the surface is covered
with a froth formation, somewhat like the head of a
cauliflower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The fluid is fermenting.</i>—After 1 to 1½ hours the froth
forming gradually ceases and finally drops.</p>

<p>During fermentation lead the rubber hose attached to
the generating flask into a smaller flask half filled with water.
You will notice bubbles oozing from the mouth of the hose
through the water. Then at once make a test by holding a
lighted match into the small flask. The match will burn
readily, just as it would in the air. After ten or fifteen
minutes repeat this procedure and the burning match will be
extinguished at once, even to the glimmer.</p>

<p>During the first test atmospheric air only was contained
in the small flask. It required a little time for the gas of
the generating flask to displace the atmospheric air, as a
result of which the lighted match went out at the second
test.</p>

<p>Another peculiar phenomenon is noticeable in connection
with this test. On top of the water in the open flask
the developed gas remains stationary, but can be dispersed
by an air current, either created by blowing or by waving
the hand over the opening of the bottle.</p>

<p>If we then pour some clear lime water into another small
bottle and allow some of the gas from the generating flask
by means of the rubber tubing to flow into the same, we will
find that, after withdrawing the hose, closing the bottle with
the thumb and slightly shaking the contents, the lime water
turns milky.</p>

<p>This is caused by a combination of the dissolved lime
and the gas. The latter, which we have developed, is Carbon
Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>

<p>By the above tests we find that Carbon Dioxide is
heavier than the atmosphere, and thus remains in the bottle
undisturbed by atmospheric pressure, for a time, as it combines
very slowly with the air. By creating a draught, the
combining with the air is facilitated.</p>


<h3>Top and Bottom Yeast.</h3>

<p>Remove with a glass rod, during active fermentation, a
little of the froth from the saccharine infusion and wash it
off with a few drops of clean water, and place a small drop
of the solution upon the object glass of the microscope. At
300 to 500 magnified strength we notice that the froth consists
of small round or oval bubbles, which occasionally,
though seldom, are elongated. They appear singly or in
groups, and often look like strings of pearls. These bubbles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
are yeast cells. Figure 5 shows yeast cells after five hours
of propagation. Each cell has a thin covering of fibrin or
cellulose; while the interior contains a soft granular albuminous
substance, called Plasma, or Protoplasma.</p>

<p>During vigorous fermentation at a temperature of 68 to
80 degrees F., the majority of the bubbles are forced to the
surface of the fluid by the action of the escaping Carbon
Dioxide, and at the final stages of fermentation gradually
precipitate. At a temperature of 36 to 45 degrees F. the
fermentation is slower, the generating Carbon Dioxide is
less active in escaping and without sufficient force to bring
the bubbles to the surface. The yeast cells to a great
extent grow and settle on the bottom of the generating
vessel.</p>

<p>These characteristics designate top and bottom yeast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;"><a id="Fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/image077.jpg" width="360" height="361" alt="more yeast magnified" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 5.</div>
</div>

<p>Both of these yeasts are of the same species, and either
can be converted into the other by the changing of the temperature
during propagation. They are recognizable by a
slight difference in size. Owing to the more favorable conditions
during growth top yeast is somewhat better developed
than bottom yeast. Compressed yeast used in bread
baking is top yeast.</p>

<p><i>Distillation Test.</i>—After the fermentation in the generating
flask has ceased, and no more bubbles rise to the surface
of the fluid, test it by distillation. For this purpose we
first filter the saccharine fluid to remove the yeast cells.
Place the clear filtrate in a clean flask, stop it with a perforated
rubber cork, and connect it by means of a bent glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
tube with a cooling apparatus. Figure 6 shows such an apparatus.
The vapor generated from the filtrate contained in
the flask passes through the coil in the cooler, as shown in
the illustration. The cooler is provided with tube connections
at the lower and upper ends, which can be fitted with
perforated corks, through which glass tubes may be inserted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 301px;"><a id="Fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/image078.jpg" width="301" height="553" alt="still" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 6.</div>
</div>

<p>The lower tube by means of rubber tubes is connected
with the cold water faucet, not shown in the illustration; the
flow of cold water around the coil can be regulated at the
faucet and drawn off at the upper tube.</p>

<p>In lieu of a cooler as shown, one can be constructed by
leading the tube of the filtrate flask into a somewhat wider
and longer glass tube, which is connected with a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
bottle. The long glass tube, in this case, must be kept cool
by constantly pouring cold water over it during distillation.</p>

<p>When all connections have been made tight, heat the
filtrate over an alcohol lamp to a boiling point, the flask
having been placed on a piece of wire gauze to equalize the
heat. The arising vapors passing through the coil are condensed,
and drip like tears into a receptacle placed underneath
the cooler. This evaporating and condensing of a
fluid is called distillation.</p>

<p>The portion of the condensed fluid coming over at the
beginning will be found, if tasted, to be very strong spirits
of alcohol. Light it with a taper, it will produce a large
bluish flame.</p>

<p>As the distillation continues the spirits coming over lose
gradually in strength until finally very little else but the
vapors of water are condensed. Water boils at 212 degrees
F., spirits of alcohol at 172 degrees F. We would therefore
infer that at the beginning of distillation it is possible to
recover alcohol only if the infusion was heated to 176
degrees F.</p>

<p>This view, however, is erroneous. The boiling point of
the mixture is only slightly greater than that of pure alcohol,
and the generated vapors are already at the beginning
and combination of both fluids, although at first the proportion
of alcohol is the greater.</p>

<p>We have now seen that yeast is capable of producing
alcohol and carbon dioxide. This is called alcoholic
fermentation.</p>

<p>Wine, beer, brandy and other spirituous liquors are produced
by alcoholic fermentation, and the same is attributed
to the raising of bread doughs.</p>

<p>The yeast cell in its search for nutriment consumes and
changes the sugar, to facilitate growth, finally reducing it
into simpler bodies of alcohol and carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>The chemical changes of the sugar are due to the ever-changing
composition of the albuminous plasma of the yeast
cell. When the plasma has lost the power to renew itself, it
dies and putrefaction sets in.</p>

<p>Worts of sugar and diffusible albuminous solutions are
ideal foods for yeast, as they readily permeate the fine,
porous coverings of the yeast cells to nourish the plasma,
which at the same time, by its own action, creates the
requisite warmth by the dissolution of the sugars with alcohol—carbon
dioxide.</p>

<p>The following description will illustrate how this is
accomplished:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Make a drumhead, by stretching and fastening a piece
of bullock’s bladder or either vegetable or animal parchment
paper over a cylinder of glass. Place this in a vessel containing
pure water, and pour into the cylinder a strong
solution of common salt. The salt brine and the pure water
are only separated from each other by the thin membrane
of the bladder or the parchment. After a little while it will
be noticed that the salt solution will have diffused out
through the membrane until the liquid, both outside and
inside the floating cylinder, has the same strength. This is
called osmose, or dialysis.</p>

<p>In choosing its nutriment yeast is very selective. Of the
carbohydrates, glucose, maltose and those of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
group are capable of direct fermentation, and are quickly and
vigorously changed by yeast. In direct opposition, we find
that cane sugar, beet sugar, as well as the starch of flour, are
not fermentable until chemically changed. This change is
brought about by yeast itself.</p>

<p>The plasma of the yeast contains an albuminous substance
called Invertin. As explained above, the Invertin, by
dialysis, is diffused out through the cell covering and changes
cane sugar and sugars of the same class, as well as part of
the flour starch, into fermentable sugar, known as invert
sugars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Reproduction of Yeast.</i>—During fermentation yeast nourishes
and reproduces itself. The granulations of the living
plasma divides itself, and with a portion of the plasma forms
a small protuberance at one end of the cell; it then enters
the neck, which is gradually developed by the contraction of the
cell wall and forms a bud.</p>

<p>The neck finally closes, the budding daughter cell releases
itself from the parent cell, and each are then an individual
organism.</p>

<p>This operation is known as “budding.” Each parent cell
is capable of giving off several buds in succession. The
daughter cells in their turn reproduce in the same manner,
and so with remarkable rapidity yeast cells multiply.</p>

<p>But yeast is also reproduced by spores termed
“ascospores.”</p>

<p>In this case yeast cells do not throw out a bud, but the
plasma divides itself into (usually) four portions called
spores, each of which surrounds itself with a thin membrane.</p>

<p>These spores, when set free by the dissolution of the
cellulose coverings of the parent cells, on account of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
minuteness float away into the atmosphere. If by chance they
drop into the proper medium, such as malt wort or flour
barms, spontaneous fermentation sets in.</p>

<p>This is recognized by the fact of spontaneous fermentation
frequently and easily occurring in the fermenting rooms
of yeast factories and breweries, as innumerable quantities
of spores are present in the atmosphere at all times.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Pure Yeast Cultures.</i>—By the manner in which yeast
nourishes and reproduces itself, we acknowledge it to be a
plant of exceedingly elemental structure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;"><a id="Fig_7"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 7.<br />
Growing Yeast After 8 Hours’ Propagation.</div>
</div>

<p>Being devoid of the green coloring matter of the plant
(chlorophyll), the yeast cell is incapable of assimilating
inorganic matter, such as carbon, nitrogen, ammonia and
certain mineral salts, for the purpose of building up their
tissues.</p>

<p>Yeast belongs to the family of Fungi, and on account
of the peculiar manner of its reproduction is classified as
“Sprouting Fungi.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>We are obliged to admit that the true nature of the
yeast cell has as yet never been entirely satisfactorily explained.
Some scientists are of the opinion that yeast cells
are but the embryo of higher fungi development; for it is
known as a fact that certain species of the sprouting fungi
do not possess the faculty to incite alcoholic fermentation,
while, on the other hand, some of the higher species of mould
fungi possess the qualification not alone to incite alcoholic
fermentation, but are also capable of ascospore formation.
So much for this explanation.</p>

<p>It has been proven by actual results that different species
of yeast produce widely different kinds of fermented liquid.
These differences are recognized in the yeast cell of wine,
of beer, and of the distillery, the last named being also the
yeast of dough fermentation.</p>

<p>If the yeast cell of wine be placed in a beer wort, the
fermented wort will assume a vinous flavor, and is known as
maltine.</p>

<p>Science has shown that yeast cells are composed of
groups of various species. The principal species, among
others, as found in brewers’ or distillers’ yeasts, are known
as Sacchoromyces Cerevisial and Sacchoromyces Pastorianus.</p>

<p>Both are very much alike in appearance, both incite
alcoholic fermentation, but develop in a similar wort a number
of widely different by-products, the analyses of which
have thus far baffled the resources of the chemist. The
action of these two species is readily recognized by the
flavor and taste imparted to the fermented medium.</p>

<p>As the bouquet imparted to wine is attributed to the
wine yeast cell (Sacchoromyces Ellipsoideus), characteristic
of the grape juice, so the baker recognizes by the flavor of
his baked product that the proper species of yeast has been
employed, irrespective of the flavor which may have been
obtained by other materials used in the baking.</p>

<p>While it is difficult to separate the various species of
yeast cells, the phenomena of spore formation has led the
way to accomplish it.</p>

<p>At a temperature of 54 degrees F., Sacchoromyces Cerevisial
will show ascospore formation in 200 hours, while
Sacchoromyces Pastorianus at the same temperature forms
spores already in 77 hours. This difference in time of the
maturing of the spore formation of the various species of
yeast being known, is utilized in transferring the spore of
any specific species upon culture plates of nutrient gelatine,
upon which the spores develop into little colonies of yeast
cells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The healthiest and strongest appearing cell is then cut
out with a sterilized platinum wire and transferred into a
flask of sterilized malt wort, and the reproduction from a
single cell of any given species is begun. In this manner
pure yeast culture is accomplished.</p>

<p>In the fermenting vats growing yeasts are often contaminated
by spores of undesirable species from the atmosphere,
and result in producing conditions unfavorable for the purposes
desired. In such cases we must resort to a pure yeast
culture to re-establish the desired fermentation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Manufacture of Compressed Yeast.</i>—Compressed yeast
is the result of alcoholic fermentation of malt and grain
worts. As it is of material interest to the baker to acquaint
himself with a general knowledge regarding the manufacture
of compressed yeast, a short but clear description is given
below.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Treating the Grain.</i>—Malt is produced by soaking barley
or other grains in water and spreading in thin layers on
the floors of the malting rooms. Being moist and in consequence
supplied with artificial heat, the grains begin to
sprout. As the rootlets grow in size a product is being
formed in the germ that has the power to convert starch
into sugar. This product is called Diastase. This reaction
is still clouded with a good deal of mystery, and it has as
yet never been clearly defined.</p>

<p>We know this much, however, that some parts of the
nitrogenous matter of grains are chemically changed into
Diastase.</p>

<p>Practice teaches the maltster, by the size the rootlets
attain, when the maximum diastasic strength of the malt has
been reached.</p>

<p>The sprouting of the malt is now arrested by drying the
malt in kilns at a temperature of 131 to 176 degrees F., which
evaporates the moisture and kills further germination.</p>

<p>For malting purposes barley is mostly used, as its
diastasic strength exceeds that of any other grain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Yeast Mash.</i>—For preparing the yeast mash crushed
malt and rye is employed, although other grains are used
to replace part of the rye, such as corn and buckwheat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Experience teaches, however, that the best results are
obtained by the use of barley malt and rye only.</p>

<p>The materials are selected with great care. The water
employed is boiled, the rye must be clean and free from
dust, and the malt free from mould. The rye is first soaked
in water and then crushed.</p>

<p>In 200 liters of water at 125 degrees F., 100 kg. of the
grains are mixed and constantly stirred for thirty minutes,
until all lumps have disappeared, the temperature in the
meantime remaining constant. At this temperature the dissolving
of the albuminous matters of the grains is favored,
and the changing of the starches into sugar and dextrin is
facilitated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Saccharification of the Mash.</i>—At the expiration of the
thirty minutes the temperature of the mash is gradually
increased by steam from 122 to 158 degrees F., and constantly
stirred.</p>

<p>It has been substantiated that these temperatures are
best suited for a perfect gelatinization and saccharification
of the starches without injuring the diastasic properties of
the malt. At the same time, a temperature of 158 degrees
F., which is continued for two hours, is useful to effectually
sterilize the mash by destroying the undesirable bacteria.
During this time the diastase, which, as we have seen, was
produced in the sprouting barley during malting, effects its
function in the quickest possible manner. The result is a
very sweet, lasting fluid.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain whether the saccharification has
been complete, a small portion of the mash is filtered and
tested with a drop of tincture of iodine. When the tincture
of iodine discontinues to produce a blue coloring in the
filtered fluid the saccharification is complete.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Acidulation of the Mash.</i>—This is probably the most
momentous stage of compressed yeast manufacturing, and
watchfulness must be practiced, if the object be to produce
a pure yeast free from all possible contamination.</p>

<p>The means used for this purpose is the introduction of
lactic acid fermentation. The mash is covered up, occasionally
the mash is stirred, but always from bottom upward,
so as to bring as large a surface as possible in contact with
the atmosphere (oxygen), while the mash is kept at a temperature
favorable to lactic ferment growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason for this acidulation is twofold. In the first
place, the lactic ferments assist in converting the insoluble
albuminous matters of the grains into soluble matter. Technically,
this is known as changing the albuminoids into
peptones.</p>

<p>In the second place, lactic ferment is absolute poison for
the undesirable bacteria, which may have developed, without
injuring in any way the yeast cells proper, but rather has
an influence for good toward them. Sulphuric acid is sometimes
added to increase the acidity.</p>

<p>When the acidity reaches 2½ per cent. in the mash it is
ready for further manipulation. Apparatuses to indicate the
per cent. of acidity developed are used for the purpose of
accuracy.</p>

<p>The acidulation of the mash having been satisfactorily
completed, further operations are dependent upon the
method selected to produce yeast. The older method is
known as the “Vienna Process,” while the newer method is
called “Aeration Process.”</p>


<h3>The Older or Vienna Process.</h3>

<p><i>Fermentation of the Mash.</i>—At the completion of the
acidulation of the mash it is at once cooled to 77 degrees F.
This is accomplished by continuously agitating the mash by
mechanical means with hollow plungers that are filled with
ice or cold water, and which at the same time serves to
aerate the mash.</p>

<p>The former method of cooling the mash in shallow vats,
on account of infection and introduction by and of undesirable
bacteria from the atmosphere into the mash, has been
generally discarded.</p>

<p>Fermentation is now introduced by adding a certain
quantity of compressed yeast, which must be free from
starch adulteration.</p>

<p>In a short time a head begins to develop upon the surface
of the mash, which gradually grows and rises to the
top of the half-filled vats. The period of fermentation
depends upon the temperature of the mash as well as the
density of the mash.</p>

<p>The higher the density of the mash, the more vigorous the
fermentation.</p>

<p>In general, the time consumed for proper fermentation
is twelve to eighteen hours.</p>

<p>As fermentation proceeds, the density of the mash becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
less, while the yeast cells increase, and at the same
time the temperature of the mash raises.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;"><a id="Fig_8"></a>
<img src="images/image086.jpg" width="393" height="390" alt="more yeast" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 8.<br />
Yeast Cells Fully Developed.</div>
</div>

<p>The mash in this process contains the whole of the
grains, and for this reason the head, which contains the
yeast cells, and which is skimmed off as it rises, must be
strained; it is subsequently washed and then pressed. In
contrast to this method the newer or “Aeration Process” for
the production of yeast presents entirely different phases.</p>


<h3>Production of Yeast by Aeration Process.</h3>

<p>This method was invented in Sweden about ten years
ago, and is in use in many yeast factories to-day. A decided
greater percentage of yeast yield is accomplished by the
“Aeration Process.”</p>

<p>After the saccharification of the mash is completed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
extract called “wort” is strained to remove the husks and
bran of the grains. Large vats containing a double bottom
are used for this purpose, the inner or upper bottom being
perforated. Spigots are attached to the bottom of the vats
to draw off the “wort.” At first the extract appears opaque
and is again returned to the mash. This pouring-back
process is continued until the “wort” finally flows perfectly
clear from the spigots. The extractive matter still adhering
to the husks and bran of the grains is washed out or
“sparged” with hot water.</p>

<p>Another way employed for recovering the clear “wort”
is by means of the filter press. The percolation method,
however, is preferable, as the extraction of the essential
properties is more complete.</p>

<p>Fermentation is produced in the “wort” by adding small
quantities of compressed yeast also, or by the use of pitching
yeast. During the fermenting period a continuous stream
of atmospheric air is forced through the “wort” by the aid
of air pumps. In order to eliminate atmospheric dust and
bacteria, the air before entering the “wort” filtered through
cotton, and sterilized by passing it through a solution of
salicylic acid. It is also necessary to distribute the air to all
parts of the “wort” equally, by means of perfected tubes,
which are attached to the main air pipe, branching out in
various directions at the bottom of the fermenting vats, with
the perforations facing downward. At the beginning the air
current is very moderate, and is increased in accordance and
in proportion of the yeast growth. At the final stages of
fermentation the air current is again moderated. This forcing
in of air, or rather oxygen, in the “wort” stimulates in an
exceedingly large measure the propagation of yeast, but care
is exercised in this respect, however, for if the air pressure
be too strong a large per cent. of alcohol, a very important
by-product, will be lost. The characteristic feature of this
method, distinguishing it from the Vienna Process, is the
continued aeration during fermentation, hence called “Aeration
Process.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Obtaining the Yeast.</i>—Fermentation of the “mash” or
the “worts” proceeds at a lively rate. In observing the “head”
or froth, during the “Vienna Process,” which at first is
transparent, gradually assumes a milky or of more opaque
appearance, caused by enormous increasing growth of yeast
cells, filling up the froth bubbles. When the cells are fully
developed the fermentation may be considered finished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Practice assumes, although the assumption is not always
reliable, that this stage has been reached when the “head”
or froth begins to recede. The only sure method to determine
proper maturity of the yeast cell is by microscopic
observation.</p>

<p>Placing some of the froth under the object glass of the
microscope, the yeast cells most appear well developed and
isolated from each other. It should be the exception rather
than the rule that budding cells still be visible.</p>

<p>Not until assured that the proper time has been reached
should the skimming of the upper portion of the froth be
begun. This portion of the “head” contains the so-called
“pitching yeast,” and is used largely in starting new
propagation.</p>

<p>Large galvanized perforated spoons with long handles
are used to skim off the froth. Repeated observations of the
froth during the skimming are made, to ascertain the condition
of the yeast cells.</p>

<p>The yeasty froth is immediately mixed with ice cold
water to arrest further fermentation. This also serves to
increase the keeping properties of the yeast.</p>

<p>The water containing the skimmed-off matter is now
run through strainers of varying sized meshes, the coarser
retaining the husks and bran, while the finer meshes prevent
the gummy matter adhering to the yeast cells from passing.</p>

<p>The strained yeast cells are caught up in vessels containing
water, where they precipitate in a compact layer, and
is then ready to be washed.</p>

<p>In order to watch the settling of the yeast, these vessels
are constructed with windows so as to give the operator a
perfect vision of the settling.</p>

<p>This operation of washing the yeast in new water and
allowing it to settle is repeated several times, at which time
nearly all of the impurities have been removed and excellent
keeping properties have been attained.</p>

<p>A newer method of washing yeast has lately been introduced
by the invention of a specially constructed patented
centerfuge. If it be intended to mix starch with the yeast,
it is usually done just after the washing has been completed.</p>

<p>Potato or rice starch are used. The utmost carefulness
must be observed in the examination of the starches, as they
frequently are contaminated with bacteria or acids, which
tend to injure the keeping qualities of the yeast and very
soon become unfit for use.</p>

<p>After the clear water of the last washing has been removed
by decantation, the compact settled mass is pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
dry by hydraulic or filter press, and finally formed by specially
constructed machines into pound pieces, familiar to all
bakers.</p>

<p>The “mash” or the “wort” after the yeast has been
removed contain alcohol in paying quantities, and is recovered
by distillation.</p>

<p>One hundred kilograms of mash yields an average of 11
per cent. yeast and 28 per cent. of alcohol, if fermented
according to the “Vienna Process.” The “Aeration Process”
yields 25 per cent. of yeast and 18 per cent. of alcohol. The
remaining grains in the liquids are much sought after for
their value as desirable fodder for cattle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Yeast Adulteration.</i>—High class compressed yeast should
be free from all adulterants. Most manufacturers, on
account of the slimy matter of yeast, causing many difficulties
in pressing, add from 5 to 10 per cent. of potato starch,
claiming that it increases the keeping qualities by absorbing
part of the moisture. The writer, however, does not
agree with them.</p>

<p>Starch is undoubtedly at times added to yeast in large
excess; it then becomes an adulteration; this fraud is, however,
readily detected by treating the sample of yeast with
iodine. For this purpose break up a little of the yeast in a
test tube with some water, shake it up well and add a few
drops of tincture of iodine; after standing a little while the
starch will settle at the bottom of the tube in a dark blue
layer.</p>

<p>Plaster of paris has also been found in yeast; this, besides
being fraudulent, is decidedly criminal, and verily, is
giving a “stone for bread.”</p>

<p>Nature of and Examination of Compressed Yeast.—A
good sample of compressed yeast should have a creamy
white color. A brownish discoloration would indicate that
fermentation had been too far prolonged before skimming.
It should have an odor of apples, not cheesy; neither should
it have an acid odor or taste. A piece of blue litmus paper
pressed against the cut of the yeast should remain neutral
or at the most show but a faint sign of red; a marked change
in the paper from blue to red would indicate acidity.</p>

<p>A microscopic view of good yeast dissolved in water
should have the appearance as seen in <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, shown above.
When broken it should show a fine fracture, irregularly
rounded. Should it be crumbly, deterioration has set in.
In lukewarm water it should melt readily, and not be sloppy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to the touch. The dissolved yeast placed in a glass tube
should settle slowly and evenly with the water above it perfectly
clear. During this test adulteration with plaster of
paris is readily detected, as it would be the first to settle
out, and by carefully decanting the fluid, examination of the
sediment would disclose plaster of paris.</p>

<p>If the solution of yeast and water does not clear itself
the yeast is spoiled, and is of no use for the fermenting of
doughs. It is contaminated with wild yeast and harmful
bacteria, and would be instrumental in starting putrefactive
fermentation, ruining the flavor of baked goods. Should we
desire to ascertain the amount of starch present in an adulterated
yeast, the following method is applicable:</p>

<p>Weigh a small beaker and a small glass rod on a very
accurate scale; or, better still, on an analytical balance, and
assume the weight to be 17.5 g. In the beaker place 10 g.
of the compressed yeast under examination; break it up fine
with the glass rod, and place the beaker in a hot water bath
for several hours, weighing occasionally until two consecutive
weighings are exactly equal; for instance, 21.2 g. We
deduct from this the weight of the beaker and glass rod,
giving us the following figures: 21.2 g. - 17.5 = 3.7 g.</p>

<p>The quantity of moisture evaporated out of the yeast
would therefore be 10 g. - 3.7 = 6.3 g. According to the
findings of Hayduck, pressed yeast contains originally 73.5
per cent. and dry starch 36 per cent. of moisture.</p>

<p>We now proceed to make deductions to determine the
quantity of starch contained as an adulterant in the mixture.
We set the example: “What per cent. of starch is contained
in a mixture of yeast and starch if 10 g. of the mixture gives
off by evaporation 6.3 g. of moisture, yeast containing 75.3
per cent. and starch 36 per cent. of moisture?”</p>

<p>Solution.—One hundred g. of pure press yeast, heated to
dryness, gives off 73.5 g.; therefore, 10 g. heated should give
off 7.35 per cent. moisture.</p>

<p>In our test the loss is but 6.3 g., consequently a deficiency
of 1.04 g. This in itself indicates starch adulteration.</p>

<p>Starch gives off 36 per cent. of moisture; therefore, 1 g.
gives off 0.36 g., and 1 g. of yeast 0.735 g. of moisture. With
each 1 g. of starch addition the moisture loss is found to be
0.735 - 0.36 = 0.375 g. deficient.</p>

<p>In the 10 g. mixture under examination there is contained
as many times 1 g. of starch as 0.375 g. is contained
in 1.05 g., which is equal to 2.8 g. In a 100 g. mixture the
result would be 28 g., or 28 per cent., which is the per cent.
of starch adulteration in our mixture examined.</p>

<h3>The Fermenting Strength of Yeast.</h3>

<p>The best manner for the baker to test the strength of
yeast is to take equal parts of the samples of the various
yeasts, about 10 g.; dissolve in 100 g. of water at 85 degrees
F., and make a dough with equal amounts of the same bread
flour (about 1990 g.).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 442px;"><a id="Fig_9"></a>
<img src="images/image091.jpg" width="442" height="563" alt="acid measuring device" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 9.</div>
</div>

<p>In order to prevent transferring of any one yeast sample
to either of the other doughs, it is advisable to thoroughly
wash the hands between each mixing. Place the doughs
in glass jars of equal dimensions, and allow them to raise
at an even temperature. It goes without saying that all
ingredients must be weighed exactly alike, and the temperatures
in all cases be the same. The yeast which gives the
greatest expansion of the dough has the preference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Another simple manner to test the strength of yeast is
to drop a piece of the dough into tepid water (85 degrees
F.), and observe the time consumed between immersion and
when the piece of dough rises to the surface of the water.
The dough which rises in the shortest time contains the
strongest yeast.</p>

<p>Of course, in technical schools yeast strength is determined
along different lines. A Hayduck carbonic acid measuring
apparatus is used for this purpose, and is shown in
cut (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>). It consists of two connecting glass tubes
fastened against a board. The wider of the tubes has a
capacity of 500 cc., and ends at the top in a narrow glass
tube, to which rubber tubing may be attached, and is graduated
in cubic centimetres. The other narrow tube ends at top
funnel-shaped.</p>

<p>Through the funnel the apparatus is filled with water,
colored blue to make observations easily. In order that the
water may not absorb any of the carbonic acid gas, which
would tend to make the test inaccurate, on top of the water
in the wider tube a thin layer of petroleum is poured.</p>

<p>In gas generating flasks (A) a suitable “wort” and a
definite amount of yeast, to be tested, is dissolved and placed
in a water bath. (B) is a second flask for the next following
test. (C) is a pinch-cock, which is left open so long as
(D) is kept closed. The generated carbonic acid gas forces
the water out of the wide tube and is caught up at (G).
The yeast which has the ability to displace the largest
amount of water at stated periods is considered the best fermentation
inciter. Before any readings are taken the water
in both tubes is brought to the same level by means of
cock (E).</p>

<p>If care be taken to use the exact proportions of materials
in each test at even temperature, reliable conclusions
are obtained from each individual yeast sample.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Water.</i>—Next to flour, water is the most abundant compound
used by the baker. It is the great solvent of Nature.
Pure water is composed of the two gases, hydrogen and oxygen,
in proportions of 1 to 8. It is colorless and tasteless.</p>

<p>Water as found in nature is never pure. Owing to its
action as a solvent, it contains bodies like lime, magnesia
and potash in solution, besides air, carbon dioxide and other
mineral matters. Hard water is such as contains more than
seven grains of mineral salts per gallon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The hardness due to bicarbonate of lime may be neutralized
by boiling. Other mineral salts are penniment.</p>

<p>In general, soft water is more adaptable for bakers’ use,
as hard water retards fermentation and somewhat checks
the softening changes going on in the dough during fermentation.</p>

<p>Doughs made with hard water require to lay longer to
properly mature.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that the baker will find it necessary
at equal dough temperatures to modify his methods when
using hard or soft waters to get uniform results.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance that water used in the
bakery be free from organic matter that is detrimental to
health, as many such organisms have a tendency to set up
putrefactive fermentation in doughs.</p>

<p>In a broad sense, however, water that is declared fit for
drinking purposes can be safely employed in bread work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Salt.</i>—Chemically known as chloride of sodium. It is
produced from three different sources: Bay or sea salt, rock
or mine salt, and natural brine or pit salt. Of these the
refined product of natural brine or pit salt is to be preferred
by bakers.</p>

<p>It should be dry, to insure uniform results, as wet salt
contains a large percentage of water, which interferes with
obtaining accurate and uniform quantities needed in the
doughs.</p>

<p>It is added to doughs in varying amounts, from 1½ to 4
pounds per barrel of flour, and gives bread flavor and taste.
When working with soft water more salt is required than in
hard water. While salt gives the bread flavor, it also retards
fermentation. It is especially of import by keeping in check
lactic and butyric fermentation, causing sour bread. Authorities
claim that salt in all proportions from 1.4 per cent.
upwards retards fermentation and diminishes the speed of
gas evolution, the raising of the dough.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Milk.</i>—Is largely used in bread making. Dry milk on
account of its convenience, has supplanted fluid milk in a
large measure in the bakery.</p>

<p>Although not universally accepted, the writer is of the
opinion that dry milk containing pure butter fat will add
equal flavor to bread in which fluid milk is used.</p>

<p>Besides giving flavor and nourishing properties to bread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
on account of its dryness it has water absorptive qualities
that are of economic value to the baker.</p>

<p>Dry milk also contains soluble extracts that have an
invigorating influence on yeast growth, i. e., fermentation,
and improves and gives a better bloom in the crust of the
bread.</p>

<p>In point of economic value, the baker should determine,
by making small trial doughs, the increased volume obtained
by reason of the extra moisture absorbing properties of dry
milk when used in doughs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Fat.</i>—Lard, compound lard and cotton-seed oil are the
fats generally employed in bread making. The use of fats
effects a finer texture in the bread.</p>

<p>A colorless shortening assists in producing a whiter
crumb, and also by coating the cells of the loaf retains the
moisture of the baked bread. Doughs containing large
amounts of shortening, under best and equal conditions, will
stand a larger amount of proof, as part of the shortening in
a well mixed dough has combined with the gluten of the
flour used, allowing it to stretch further and become more
elastic and still hold the increased amount of gas generated
by the heat of the oven, and produces a loaf of greater
volume.</p>

<p>Not all shortenings will produce the same effect, and
the baker should experiment with small batches. The points
to be determined are the effect the shortening has on the
crust, volume of the loaf, as well as the color.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Sugar.</i>—Among the sugar groups used in the bakery we
find cane sugar, malt extracts, glucose and yeast foods.</p>

<p>Each of these products have characteristic effects on
fermentation and doughs, and will be treated in a later paper.</p>

<h2>DOUGHS LEAVENED BY
YEAST<br />

<small>BY PROF E. W. HABERMAAS</small></h2>


<p>There are two distinct ways of making doughs. One
way is to set a sponge first, then make the dough, and the
other way is to make the dough at once. The first is called
a “Sponge Dough” and the second is called a “Straight
Dough.” Straight dough is so called, because all ingredients
such as yeast, salt, sugar, lard, water and flour are all mixed
and formed into a dough. There are various reasons for
making straight doughs, a few of which we will proceed
to give. In the first place, it is more convenient to make a
straight dough, because it does not require as much time to make
as does mixing the sponge dough, because the mixing is all done
at one time. Then, again, a straight dough can be taken in a
shorter time than a sponge dough. By this I mean that in case
of necessity the dough can be taken, in from 1½ to 2 hours
after it has been made. I do not advocate taking the dough
in such a short time, but it can be done, because I have
done it with good results.</p>

<p>Straight dough requires more yeast than doughs made
from a sponge, because the yeast has not as favorable a
medium in which to grow, in the straight dough as it has
in the sponge dough. It is conceded by some that straight
dough requires a stronger flavor than a dough made from a
sponge; by others that a stiffer dough is required; by others,
that the finished product has a coarse texture, and that an
“yeasty” taste predominates. The author made straight
doughs daily for eleven years successfully. He neither made
a specially stiff dough nor did his finished product have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
coarse texture nor an “yeasty” taste. Sometimes when the
temperature of the shop was very high or an exceptionally
weak flour was sent us, then would our product have a somewhat
coarse texture, but this would soon be remedied by
using less yeast and reducing the temperature of the liquid
used. There are advantages in using strong flour, but they
are alike in the straight and the sponge dough, and they
are larger yields and larger goods, but these are not the
only points to be considered.</p>

<p>Some bakers are partial to spring wheat flour, because
the yield in bread is greater than when a blend is used.</p>

<p>Too often is quantity preferred to quality. It seems
that most bakers are working to the one end, namely, to
get the flour which yields most bread. In this endeavor
they are sacrificing quality for quantity.</p>

<p>Spring flour containing a larger per cent. of gluten than
winter wheat flour naturally takes up more moisture, producing
in turn more bulk, therefore more bread.</p>

<p>Then again the gluten in the spring wheat flour is of a
tenacious character, producing a tough elastic dough. Such
a dough can resist a greater gas pressure than can one made
of weaker flour, and can therefore stand more proof, thus
producing a larger and better appearing loaf than one made
of a winter wheat flour or a blend.</p>

<p>If a blend is used, we will say two parts of a high grade
winter wheat, and one part of spring wheat flour, and the
dough is properly worked, the bread will have a fine, smooth,
soft, velvety texture, and a mild, sweet taste. The loaf will
not be as large a loaf as the one made of spring wheat flour,
but will remain soft and moist longer than the loaf made of
spring wheat flour. The reason for this is, that winter wheat
flour contains a larger per cent. of natural moisture and a
smaller per cent. of gluten than the spring flour, therefore
it takes up less moisture, and consequently does not lose
as much by evaporation in baking; thus leaving a larger
per cent. of moisture in the bread.</p>

<p>The chemist’s test cannot decide the true baking value
of a flour. A bakeshop test, made by a practical baker, is
absolutely necessary to decide this matter.</p>

<p>The principal points to be considered when making
straight dough are these: the temperature of the ingredients,
the temperature of the shop, the quantity of yeast,
and the quality of the flour used. If the temperature of
the shop is very high, the liquid used should be cool, and
the quantity of yeast should be reduced.</p>

<p>The most favorable temperature for fermentation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
from 80 to 90 degrees Fahr., though I prefer to have the
dough 85 degrees Fahr.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to make the dough, take the temperature
of the flour and the shop, then heat the water to a
temperature which will give your dough a temperature of
80 degrees Fahr. when ready. For example, if the temperature
of your flour were 5 degrees Fahr., the temperature
of the water would have to be 10 degrees Fahr. Now if
the temperature of the shop were 70 degrees Fahr., the
temperature of the water could be raised to 110 degrees
Fahr. I would advise you not to get the temperature of
the dough too high, but would rather that you raise the
temperature of your shop. Dough chills very quickly when
it is on the bench, and after a dough is chilled it will come
up very slowly. When making dough in a dough-mixer,
the temperature of the water should be at least 5 degrees
higher than when making it by hand, because the mixers
are more or less cold, while, when dough is made by hand
you have the animal heat of the hands to keep up the
temperature of the dough. When the weather is very warm,
the temperature of the water must be changed to suit. For
example, if the temperature of your shop is 90 degrees Fahr.,
your flour would naturally be very near the same temperature
(providing it were kept in the shop), then the temperature of
the water would have to be at the utmost 75 degrees Fahr.,
because the temperature of the dough would continue to
rise while it was in the trough or mixer.</p>


<h3>Process for Making Straight Dough.</h3>

<p>Heat the liquid to the required temperature, then dissolve
the yeast in a portion of the liquid, then, when the
yeast is dissolved, add it to the rest of the liquid; then add
the salt and dissolve it; then add the fats and sugar; then
add the flour. (As above mentioned for uniform results it is
best to weigh the flour, sugar, salt and fats.) After the
flour has been added, work it into a smooth dough.</p>


<h3>Weighing and Measuring Ingredients Used in Baking.<br />

<span class="subtitle">By Professor E. W. Habermaas.</span></h3>

<p>All solids used in baking should be weighed, and all
liquids should be measured accurately. Varied results and
failures in baking are very often due to inaccurate weighing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and measuring of ingredients. If your recipe calls for a
pound of sugar, don’t use 1¼ pounds instead. Or if a recipe
calls for 1 gallon of milk, don’t use ⅞ gallon instead. The
author has often seen bakers use 1¼ pounds of some ingredient
when 1 pound was what should have been used.
Many bakers are exceptionally careless about measuring the
liquids, such as milk and water. They will dip a quart or
pint measure into a can of milk or into a bucket of water
and draw it out on a slant, thus causing a portion of the
liquid to run out. Often as much as one-fourth of a pint of
milk will run out of the measure, still they will count that
a full measure. This may seem a trifle, but when measuring
a number of quarts or pints, it ceases to be a trifling matter
but becomes a matter of vital importance. For example,
you are about to make a dough of four quarts of milk or
water, and you measure the milk or water as above shown.
After having added the flour and you are making the dough,
you will find that the dough is too stiff. This is based on
the fact that you use a given quantity of flour to every quart
of milk or water used, as should be the case, if you expect
uniform results. You have the correct amount of flour, but
not enough milk or water. Then again, the yield of such
a dough would be less than it should be. Most bakers do
not weigh the flour for their dough. Where this is the
case, flour is usually added until the dough is of the proper
consistency. So in that case the fact that the baker had not
measured the liquid accurately would not necessitate getting
too stiff a dough, because he has not a given quantity of
flour to work in but adds it until the dough is of the proper
consistency, but the yield will be less because there is less
dough.</p>

<p>I do not approve of this method of making doughs,
because the results are not uniform, and it requires more
time to make the dough, because you are compelled to add
more flour occasionally to get the proper consistency.
Whereas, when you have the exact amount of flour and add
it at once, you can proceed with dough without interruption.
Then again, when you weigh the flour for your dough,
you always have uniform results.</p>

<p>The flour, sugar, malt extract, salt and fats (if any)
should be weighed, and the milk or water measured or
weighed for every batch of dough, no matter how large or
how small, if you would have uniform results.</p>

<p>One of the “hit or miss” methods prevalent in most
shops is that bakers measure the water and weigh the salt,
and guess at the rest. Fats, sugar and flour are seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
weighed. What are the consequences? Sometimes they have
a stiff dough, sometimes a soft dough, and sometimes a medium
dough. Sometimes the dough comes up too fast and sometimes
too slow, owing to the consistency of the dough. Then, again,
they never get the same number of loaves out of the same size
batch. If the dough is too stiff, they get more than the required
number, and if the dough is too soft they get less than the required
number out of the batch.</p>

<p>In large shops such methods would not be tolerated,
then why should they be tolerated in small shops? Thousands
of dollars could be saved monthly in bakeshops if more
accurate methods were adopted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When using a very strong flour you can use a little more
yeast than ordinarily without fear of mincing the dough, because
strong flour can stand more proof; but unless absolutely necessary,
don’t use any more yeast than is required under ordinary
conditions. During the summer months it is well to use more
salt than during cold weather, because salt acts as a governor—it
holds the dough in check and keeps it sweet.</p>

<p>Too much yeast creates an over-abundance of gas, and if
the dough is not tough enough to withstand the pressure of
the gas, it tears and allows the gas to escape; the dough then
falls and loses its vitality. If this dough were “made up” into
loaves, and when baked were cut in two, it would be seen that
the texture would be very coarse; it would be a mass of holes,
and the taste would betray a trace of lactic fermentation. This
bread would not be fit to eat. Don’t allow your doughs to get
too old. If a dough gets too old it loses its vitality, and when
baked it will have a coarse texture and will have a sour taste.
Test your doughs as follows: When the dough has set about
one hour, jam your hand into it; if it begins to fall it is ready
to take; if it does not fall, allow it to set about one-half hour,
then try it again. A dough may be taken before it falls, but I
would not advise you to make a practice of doing that. I have
made a batch of bread and had it baked and out of the oven
in three hours. I set the sponge at 9.30 a. m., made the dough
at 10.30 a. m., and had the bread baked at 1 p. m. This bread
had a very fine, smooth texture, and had a very sweet taste.
I advocate taking doughs as soon as they are ready, if you
want a nice, smooth texture and a sweet taste to your bread;
and trust that it is your aim to produce such a loaf.</p>

<p>The third process in the art of bread making is pushing or
“punching” the dough down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>


<h3>Pushing or “Punching” the Dough Down.</h3>

<p>When the dough is well “up,” or raised, push or “punch”
it down (using both hands), to force out the gas, then raise
up one end of the dough and lap it over the other, then push
it down again. Continue this process until the dough is firm
and compact, then cover it, and when it is up again take it. This
is done to prevent the dough from getting too old, or from
losing its vitality. When a dough is required at a certain time
and there is no time to push or punch the dough down, this
process may be omitted.</p>

<p>The fourth process in bread making is breaking the dough.</p>


<h3>Breaking the Dough.</h3>

<p>When the dough is ready remove it from the trough or bowl
and put it on the bench or table; then cut it into pieces weighing
about 10 pounds; then pat it down with both hands, then
take up one end of the dough and lap it over the other, then
pat it down again until you have the piece of dough very flat;
then fold it over and over. Continue to pat down and fold
over the dough until it is very compact, then take up the next
piece, and so on, until you have the entire batch of dough firm
and compact. In some large shops this work is done by machines
called “dough breaks.”</p>

<p>“Breaking” is done to free the dough from excessive gas
and to keep the dough young and also to produce a firm
loaf of bread. If the dough is “made up” before it has been
freed from excessive gas, it will produce a spongy loaf of bread,
with large, irregular holes in it. Such a loaf of bread will dry
out very quickly. After the dough has been freed from excessive
gas it becomes firm and compact, and the loaves of bread
made from this dough will likewise be firm and compact. (At
this period of the dough all gas contained in the dough can be
classed as “excessive,” because it is of no real value, but rather
a hindrance, because it makes additional work to get the dough
into proper shape for making it up into loaves.) Now, when
the yeast again becomes active and gas begins to form, the loaf
will raise evenly, because what gas remains in the loaf is evenly
distributed throughout the loaf, thus producing a nicely shaped
loaf.</p>

<p>The fifth process in the art of bread making is weighing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>


<h3>Weighing the Loaves.</h3>

<p>Cut the dough into pieces of as near a uniform size as possible,
then weigh them as required. The exact weight I cannot
fix; that must be determined by the price of material used, the
locality in which you are located, the cost of labor, etc.</p>

<p>In making up a selling price, every detail, such as cost of material,
labor, rent, light, fuel, heat, wrapping paper, twine, advertising
display, wear and tear on horse and wagon (if you
have any), feed, etc., salary for yourself, interest on money invested,
etc., must be figured in, or “you will come out of the
small end of the horn,” as they say.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the dough is made, proceed as follows to work it
smooth: Cut off (with a scraper) a portion of the dough and
place it on the bench, then spread it out (using both hands) as
wide and long as possible, then fold it double, then spread it
out again, as before directed, then fold it over. Continue this
process until you have a nice, smooth, dry dough, then take up
another piece of dough and proceed as directed. Continue taking
up pieces of dough and working them as directed until you
have worked the entire batch of dough, then put it in the trough
and allow it to “raise.” When making straight dough with a
dough mixer, proceed as follows: Put the water into the mixer
(but keep back a small portion in which to dissolve the yeast),
then dissolve the yeast, then put it into the mixer, then add the
sugar, fats, salt, etc., then start the mixer, then add the flour and
allow the machine to run until you have a smooth, dry dough.
Some bakers allow their mixers to run ten minutes and others allow
them to run twenty minutes. This is simply a matter of
opinion. My advice is to run the mixer until you have a smooth,
dry dough.</p>


<h3>Processes in Bread Making.</h3>

<p>Before we have the product called bread, it has passed
through fourteen processes, which I will name and describe in
rotation. The first of these processes is called setting sponge.</p>


<h3>Setting Sponge.</h3>

<p>Setting sponge is the first process in the art of bread making.
Proceed to set sponge as follows: Measure the quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
liquid desired and put it into a mixing bowl or trough, then take
out a portion of the liquid and dissolve the yeast in it (about
½ gallon for each pound of yeast used). The yeast must be
thoroughly dissolved; then add it to the rest of the liquid, then
add flour to give it the consistency of medium dough (2¼ pounds
of flour, one-half spring wheat and one-half winter wheat will
give you a fine sponge), then work it well to prevent crust from
forming on it, then allow it to raise. The length of time required
to raise the sponge depends upon conditions, namely, the
quantity of yeast used, the temperature of the shop, the temperature
of the liquid and flour, the consistency of the sponge, and
the size of the sponge. Large sponges require less yeast (in proportion),
and raise quicker than small sponges, because they are
not as easily chilled as small sponges are. Some bakers prefer
an old sponge and a young dough, while others prefer the opposite—a
young sponge and an old dough. I prefer to take the
sponge as soon as it is ready, and the dough likewise. By so
doing we always get an article that is not overproved, and without
a trace of lactic fermentation. Goods made from an old
overproved dough are not fit to eat. If you make a nice, sweet
product you will have no difficulty in establishing a good trade.
Watch the sponge and take it just as soon as it begins to fall.
If you want to test a sponge shake the vessel, and if the sponge
falls it is ready to take. If the sponge is not ready, the shaking
up which you gave the sponge will not check the growth of it.
I have taken sponge one hour old and produced excellent results.</p>

<p>The second process in the art of bread making is making
dough.</p>


<h3>Making Dough.</h3>

<p>Melt the fat (if lard or compounds are used), dissolve the
sugar and salt in the water, then add them to the sponge and
work them thoroughly, tearing the sponge to pieces and working
it until you have the whole a smooth mass, then add the flour
(in portions), enough to make a fairly stiff dough, and work it
thoroughly until you have a smooth, dry dough. Work the
dough same as when making a straight dough. Keep the dough
covered and at a temperature of not less than 80 deg. F. When
the temperature of the shop is below that, and the dough is to
be taken in two or three hours, both the sponge and the dough
must be kept above 85 deg. F. While a little chill would not
affect a dough, still it would delay it considerably. Chilling retards
the growth of the yeast, and after the dough has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
chilled it will take some time to raise its temperature to continue
the growth of the yeast cells.</p>

<p>There are various ways of hurrying doughs, a few of which
are as follows: By using a little more yeast than ordinarily,
and by making a soft dough, and by reducing the quantity of salt,
and by keeping both the sponge and the dough at a high temperature.
When using a larger per cent. of yeast than ordinarily,
watch both the sponge and the dough, and take them young
(just as soon as they are ready), or lactic (souring) fermentation
will take place. Don’t use too much yeast. Too much
yeast will give the baked product a peculiar taste, and will compel
you to be very careful in the handling of the dough, especially
so in warm weather.</p>

<h2>VARIATIONS IN BREAD TEXTURE<br />

<small>BY C. MILLER</small></h2>


<p>That there is a wide variance in texture or grain in bread
from day to day, or from batch to batch, produced under
seemingly same conditions, is not to be denied. There are
several causes, any one of which may produce the difference
between good and poor texture:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Improper fermentation, the most fruitful source.</p>

<p>(2) Improper handling or preparation of the dough previous
to panning.</p>

<p>(3) Over-proofing before baking.</p>

<p>(4) Ovens too hot or too cold.</p></div>

<p>By taking up these causes in the order named I hope to
point out to those who are not practical some of the difficulties
which confront the operative baker, and which make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
production of uniform texture in bread almost as difficult at
it would be to bail the water out of Lake Michigan with a
bucket.</p>

<p>My observation, covering a period of more than thirty
years, leads me to believe that absolutely uniform texture or
grain in bread will never be produced so long as we make
bread with yeast. This brings me to the first cause named,
that of fermentation.</p>

<p>As there are no known mechanical means of determining
the amount or degree of fermentation in dough, this must be
left to the judgment of the baker, and his judgment is prone
to err. If the dough is under-fermented the resultant texture
of the bread will most likely be rough, waxy and heavy to
the eye and touch. If the dough be over-fermented, the texture
takes on a grayish look and feels coarse and dry and
inclines to crumble. The difference in time between under
and over-fermentation is not long, and, as previously stated,
depends entirely upon the judgment of the operative baker,
and were his judgment infallible, which it is not, other conditions
in the bakery many times make it impossible for him
to take the dough at the proper period of fermentation, due
to the erratic and eccentric nature of fermentation of the
various batches under course of manufacture. Although made
apparently identical, in which every ingredient, including the
water, has been carefully weighed, the revolutions of the
mixing machine counted, to produce as near as possible one
dough like the other, these doughs, all of a temperature not
to vary more than half of a degree, and this temperature controlled
in a room specially constructed for this purpose—with
all of this care and fidelity to detail, it is seldom that
any two doughs will ferment exactly alike. That being so,
what may be expected where such facilities are lacking, and
where such close attention to detail is not practiced? The
subject of fermentation is a long one, and I only touch upon
it as it relates to the texture or grain of baked bread, pointing
out the difficulty of its control outside of the laboratory.</p>

<p>Taking up the second cause of poor texture (in the order
named), that of improper handling of the dough before panning,
I may say it is impossible to make bread of a fine texture
or grain without a certain amount of manipulation of
the dough during the process of fermentation. This has been
termed by the baker “cutting over” or “turning back.” If
this part of the work is not properly done there will be a
consequent sacrifice of texture or grain. This cutting over,
when properly done, consists of cutting the dough in pieces
as large as can be conveniently handled, and stretching these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
pieces as long as possible and placing the same again in the
trough, one piece on top of the other, until the entire batch
has been so treated. This serves two purposes: (1) That
of again bringing the dough, which had become warmer in
the center of the batch, to a uniform temperature throughout;
(2) it makes a more thorough distribution of the air
cells which were produced by the gases in their attempt to
escape by rising upward through the mass of dough. It is
this repeated redistribution of the air cells to finer size and
greater number which aids materially in the production of a
bread of fine texture. This can best be illustrated by calling
your attention to the “snow-flake” bread, or brake dough,
which was once quite popular in many sections of this country.
The process of manufacture, in which the dough was
run through iron rollers from twenty to thirty times, always
folding and running through the rollers again and again, is
an intensified redistribution of the air cells, and this process
produces a texture or grain very fine and pleasing to the eye
and touch.</p>

<p>The over-proofing of the dough before baking is a weakness
inherited by environment by about 99 per cent. of the
operative bakers. This desire to see a large loaf at the
expense of flavor and texture is caused largely by the criticism
of the smaller loaf by the general public. It is an inevitable
law of nature that you cannot get something for
nothing. You cannot have quality, with fine texture or grain,
and at the same time have a large loaf which only pleases
the eye on its exterior. Either quality or quantity must be
sacrificed. It is for the individual baker to say which it
shall be.</p>

<p>And last, but not least, the cause of poor texture or grain
is due to improper heat of the ovens, as without a perfect
baking heat it is quite possible to spoil the most perfect
dough. If the oven be too hot, causing the bread to crust
before the loaf has had time to become heated through, the
result will be poor grain or texture, as the gases within the
loaf would be imprisoned by the crust already formed, and
as these gases become more heated and light as the loaf
grows hotter, they eventually follow along the lines of least
resistance and break through the loaf at its weakest point of
crust already formed, causing the loaf to be ill-shaped and
drawn, and the grain to be uneven and furrowed. Again, if
the oven be too cold, the loaf is too slowly heated to stop in
time the action of fermentation, and the result would be much
the same as over-proofing—open texture with inclination to
be dry and crumbling.</p>

<h3>Greek Bread.</h3>

<p>One-half pint milk (bare measure), 1 ounce yeast, pinch
of flour, 2 eggs, ½ ounce sugar. Ferment 90 degrees F.</p>


<h3>Dough.</h3>

<p>One pound flour, ¼ pound butter, 3½ ounces sugar,

<p>Make the above quantities into a very light dough, and
allow to lie covered in warm place for 45 minutes. When
ready to turn out on to the board, hand up, and pin out
to little more than ¼ inch thick. At this stage sprinkle some
granulated sugar over the dough, splash with little water,
and bring two sides over to meet in the center, so as to
entirely enclose the sugar. Pin out again and repeat same
operation of adding sugar and folding over. The dough
will now require to be pinned out to ¼ inch thick, when it
should be cut into strips 2½ inches wide and placed on
warmed greased baking sheets. Wash with milk, sprinkle
over a good layer of granulated sugar, and place into the
prover containing little steam. When ready bake in hot oven,
allow to cool, then cut into small square pieces, according to

<h2>AMERICAN RYE BREAD
METHODS</h2>


<p>In Europe most all of the rye breads are raised with
sour dough, but American bakers employ a variety of
methods; some bakers are using the sour dough process,
others are taking a part sour dough and use compressed
yeast with it, others use a potato ferment, or compressed
yeast without sour dough. The sour dough process recommends
itself because it is cheap; all that is required is a
small piece of rye bread dough left over from the previous
day’s batch for a start; there is no yeast to pay for. It is a
process which requires experience and close attention to
make a nice and palatable bread. The difficulty lies in the
treatment of the sour dough. This dough should not be
sour, as the name would make one believe; it should be kept
up to a certain degree of sweetness by refreshing or renewing
it regularly. Rye breads made with sour dough have a
peculiar characteristic flavor; this flavor is lacking in rye
breads which are raised only with yeast.</p>

<p>A combination process, in which yeast and sour dough
are used together, either with a sponge, or also in a straight
dough, produces a sweeter loaf, and there is not as much
danger of getting the bread too sour (which may happen in
the straight sour dough process), if not closely watched.
Yeast added to the sour dough secures a stronger and shorter
fermentation, and only one sponge is used in the process,
while, with sour dough only, two successive sponges are
employed. The short yeast and sour dough process gives
just enough acidity to the dough to give a good taste.</p>

<p>Rye bread is also made with ferment. One Detroit
bakery makes from 400 to 600 loaves per day by this process.
The potato ferment is made in the afternoon (they use potato<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
flour), stocked away with dry yeast, and in the morning a
straight dough is made with ferment and more water. This
process makes a nice, moist and sweet loaf and sells well.</p>

<p>In other bakeries, the left-over pieces of rye and wheat
dough which accumulate during the day from the dough-mixer
and the dough, are used for a sort of sour dough, for
a start, or in place of the regular sour dough. The scraps
are thinned down with water, and in the evening some yeast
is added and a sponge is set with more rye flour; the rye
dough is made from this sponge afterwards. This method
works all right, but care must be taken not to add too much
old dough, and also to take the dough young, otherwise it
is apt to make a dry, flat loaf and the bread cracks easily
in baking.</p>

<p>Some bakers set a sponge with compressed yeast and rye
flour and let the sponge drop twice. The sponge is made
very slack, and contains two-thirds of the water, and the
other third part of the water is put on for the dough. Letting
the sponge drop twice gives it a little more acidity to
the dough. This process would make a much better flavored
bread if the sponge was taken on the first drop, and for
doughing three or more pounds of old rye dough added,
according to the amount of bread to be made; it would give
better flavor and make a moister loaf.</p>

<p>In other bakeries where only a small quantity of rye
bread is required, bakers do not set a separate sponge for
rye; they dip out of a broken-up wheat sponge and make the
dough with rye flour; a piece of sour dough is added by some
bakers, which gives
better flavor to bread made by this method. The sour
dough process consists of a succession of sponges; every
day a small piece of sour rye dough is left over for this
purpose to begin with. It is important in this process to
keep the sour dough from getting too old, because when
too old it becomes putrid and loses strength. Where rye
bread is not made every day, or where sour dough is kept
over from Saturday to Monday, we used to work plenty of
rye flour with some salt in the piece of dough kept over,
and make a very stiff dough, and rolled this in a well-dusted
flour bag and kept in a cold place till required. (In
southern Germany the sour dough is kept in a liquid state,
it is thinned with cold water and kept in a cold place.)
Only a small quantity is required for a start; this is freshened
up once or twice before it is made into the first and
second sponge, after which the final dough is made. For
instance, to make a batch of 100 pounds of rye flour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
into bread the procedure is as follows: Two pounds of sour
dough are freshened up with one quart of water and one
pound of rye flour into a soft sponge at about 75 to 80
degrees Fahr. After three hours add two more quarts of
water and about six pounds of flour and make this into a
medium firm sponge, this is called “grund sour.” In from
five to six hours this will be ready for the second sponge
or “voll sour.” For this second sponge add fifteen quarts
of water and with about forty pounds of flour make a soft
sponge. This sponge will be ready in from three to three
and one-half hours and drop. For the dough add fifteen
quarts of water, about one and one-half pounds of salt and
about fifty-two pounds of rye flour and make a smooth
stiff dough. After the dough is made it should not be given
much time to come on before scaling and moulding, because
the large second sponge will cause the dough to ripen
quickly during the time it is scaled and moulded. This
should be done in as short a time as possible so the first
loaves do not get too much proof before the rest is moulded.
For a smaller batch more time can be given. This process
of getting the sponges ready for the final dough may seem
tedious to some readers, but the rye bread is baked generally
during the daytime, while breads and rolls are baked
at night, the freshening-up and setting first and second
sponge is done during the night, this is particularly so where
there is only one oven.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the large rye bread bakeries, where they bake many
batches per day, a batch is baked every two and a half to three
hours. A larger “grund sour” and less water on the “voll
sour” with a moderately warm temperature ripens sponge and
doughs more rapidly and gets the bread ready for the oven
in a short time.</p>

<div class="unindent">
<i>How to make Genuine Rye Bread.</i></div>

<p>In a recent paper upon this same subject, Geo. Freeman, of
Kalamazoo, an expert baker, had the following to say upon
how to make genuine rye bread.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During my career as journeyman baker, working in
different shops, I have found there were hardly two who
made rye bread precisely the same. But although they
work different ways the result aimed at was the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Some got it pretty regularly and others did not. But since
giving the subject a little extra thought I see where I and
others have worked very much in the dark, and during the
course of my remarks I shall endeavor to throw as much
light on the subject as I possibly can, from the viewpoint
of a baker, to bakers, and so enable you (who do not already)
to see it as clearly as I do myself. I have here,
gentlemen, two loaves of what I consider genuine rye
bread, the formula for which has never given me any trouble
since I adopted it. I will tell you first how I made them
and the why and wherefore afterwards.</p>

<p>We will take for example a six gallon dough for a 125
pound batch. From the previous day’s rye sponge, I have
saved one pound of sponge in the crock and kept it in the
ice box, so the first thing I do is to take half a pint of
water and skim milk and bring it up to required temperature;
and add to the one one pound of sponge in the crock
and stir in sufficient rye flour to make a little stiff dough,
the temperature of which must be from 92 to 95 degrees,
and let stand until the sponge is ready.</p>

<p>Next take half an ounce of hops and boil about 20
minutes in two quarts of water; strain off the hops, saving
the liquor for the sponge.</p>

<p>Next I prepared the blend of flour taking 40 per cent.
blended Wisconsin rye; 20 per cent. pure black Wisconsin
rye; 40 per cent. low grade spring.</p>

<p>We now come to the sponge, making a six gallon dough.
I take four gallons for the sponge, being two-thirds of total
liquor in the sponge and one-third or two gallons at doughing
stage.</p>

<p>I take three and one-half gallons of water (at required
temperature); seven ounces of yeast, two quarts of hop
liquor, twenty-eight pounds of prepared blend of flour, about
one-third of total required.</p>

<p>Mix thoroughly. Temperature when mixed 80 degrees in
summer; 84 degrees in winter.</p>

<p>You will notice I allow seven pounds of flour to the
gallon of water in the sponge, which makes it medium soft,
causing it to show the drop good. A stiff rye sponge will
sometimes hold up on top until it is completely rotten. On
this account I have water and flour weighed accurate for
rye sponge.</p>

<p>The sponge is usually ready in three and a half to four
hours. I give it a full drop and regulate how far it comes up
the second time by the strength of the flour. In this instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the sponge took one full drop and had risen half way
up the second time when I took it. I have already had to
give the sponge the second full drop when using very
strong flour.</p>

<p>Now we come to the doughing stage: Two gallons
water (about 10 degrees lower temperature than required
for sponge); two pounds of sour from crock; one pound eleven
ounces of salt; 50 pounds of the same blend of flour as used
in the sponge. Mix good and thorough. The temperature
should be about 80 degrees in summer when finished, and 84
in winter.</p>

<p>I cover it up and allow to stand until when I push my
fist well into it and withdraw quickly, it recedes slightly instead
of resisting. It is generally one and a half to two
hours in getting ready. I then throw it out on the table
and have it scaled, rounded up, made into loaves, set in
boxes, dusted with corn meal, with the crease down and set
away to prove. When the loaves had risen or increased in
bulk about 50 per cent. we washed them over with boiled corn
starch and water, and set them in the oven to bake; the
oven being as near 400 degrees as we can get it, with steam
running in. The steam is left running in until the loaf is
done rising, then we shut it off and open the steam damper
a few minutes. A few minutes before we commence to
draw we turn the steam on again to glaze the crust, which
does away with washing after it comes out of the oven.
We let it bake until it a good rich brown and gives a firm
sound when rapped with the knuckles. The result of this
description you see in these two loaves.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, I will endeavor to tell you in as short
and plain a way as I know how why I did or did not do
certain things.</p>

<p>I will take the sour first: That is the cause of endless
trouble to most bakers, and many have stopped using it
altogether. The idea is to produce just a little acid taste
to the bread and still retain the full, sweet rye flavor, a
kind of “bitter sweet” as one may say. People who like a
little of it in their rye bread would be the first ones to
disdain sour and flavorless rye bread from over-fermentation.
And I would not blame them either. So the old fashioned
idea of adding sour is an excellent one, if conducted rightly.
And I find when it is done right it contains a high per cent.
of lactic acid—the same bacillus the farmers and dairymen
develop by letting their milk sour before churning to give
a flavor to their butter and cheese. The same bacillus gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the acid taste to buttermilk and cottage cheese, and what
German does not like them? Now milk may be said to be
the home of lactic bacillus; that is why you heard me say
add water and skim milk. The ideal temperature for its
development is 95 degrees. You notice milk turns sour very
quickly during hot weather; that is the reason.</p>

<p>Do not make the sour over night, as at the conclusion
of the lactic ferment others, undesirable, may commence and
cause you endless trouble.</p>

<p>Do not put the sour in the sponge and think to save
a little yeast that way. It may turn your whole sponge sour,
and spoil your bread. If you want a little more acid taste
to the bread, use a little more sour, and vice versa.</p>

<p>You will notice I use a little hops (or rather hop liquor)
in the sponge. The reason is to keep the sponge as pure
and sweet as possible. Rye flour differs from wheat flour
in that there is in rye flour scarcely any of what we call
gluten. It analyzes a higher content of albuminoids than
the average wheat flour, but they are nearly all soluble in
water, and therefore, ready for easy assimilation by bacteria,
and as it is this the proteids bacteria thrive on they have an
easy chance to start a very undesirable fermentation, unless
something is used to hold them in check. Therefore, I advise
using a little hops which will do it effectually.</p>

<p>Now we come to the doughing stage again: We have
kept our sponge in good condition and it is ready. We
must still keep the dough cool and maintain the alcoholic
fermentation throughout, but here we do not need to use
any hops, even though we have the sour, as here we have
the best retarder of all, plenty of salt, which not only brings
out the flavor, but holds in check all foreign ferments, as
long as there is any food left for the yeast to thrive and
work on. So be sure to take your dough as soon as you
know it is ready.</p>

<p>Regarding the blending of flour, gentlemen, everybody
knows the blend of flour to make the loaf that his trade demands.
Some places they demand a big loaf and the baker
uses more spring; some places they do not trouble about
size, and the baker used less spring and more rye.</p>

<p>I think I have said sufficient, so in conclusion let me
remind you: Keep your sponge cool, use plenty of good
yeast, do not let your sour get too old, keep your dough cool,
use plenty of salt, and do not have it wait when you know
it is ready and you will have no trouble in making Genuine
Rye Bread.</p>

<h2>MALT EXTRACT IN BREAD-MAKING</h2>


<p>What is known in the bakers’ trade as malt extract is a
natural cereal sugar syrup made by dissolving wholly or
partially malted cereals in warm water, and evaporating
the extract thus formed to a thick syrup.</p>

<p>Used in connection with bread-making it is a positive
benefit in many ways.</p>

<p>One of the most vital points in good bread-making is to
permit fermentation to proceed just far enough to ripen
the dough without injuring the delicate flavor of the gluten
in the flour. Sugar to some extent injures this delicate
flavor, giving the bread a slight acidy smell which is avoided
when malt extract is used. With sugar you also get a dead
brown color and a crust that will soften, whereas malt
extract gives a lively, snappy brown that will retain its
crispness, usually lacking when sugar is used.</p>

<p>Malt extract will shorten up the time of the doughs in
hastening fermentation and giving more life with less yeast,
and if handled properly will produce a loaf superior in every
respect.</p>

<p>The writer has watched carefully the growth of a great
many doughs during the course of fermentation, both with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sugar and malt, and while the malt process is shorter it is
much more gentle than the sugar and gives a more compact
dough from start to finish. It will also save the baker considerable
money in the course of a year, as it saves sugar
and cuts down yeast and you can almost if not entirely cut
out shortening.</p>

<p>Too much malt should not be used, as it is a powerful
factor in a dough and might defeat the purpose for which it
is used. From one pint to one quart of 120 deg. malt to the
barrel is a good proportion. Good results are obtained with
one pint malt, one pound yeast, eight quarts milk to the
barrel of flour. No sugar and no shortening. By a different
process with the use of malt, one and a half barrels of flour
can be worked with one pound of yeast, obtaining the best
of results. Of course, some flours require more than the
pint of malt to the barrel, but those flours would also require
more sugar. A quart, however, may with safety be
used to the barrel of flour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A vast amount has been written on the subject of malt
extract, many writers disagreeing as to its value. The following
article by Henry A. Kohman, of the Fellowship in
Baking Technology in the University of Kansas, covers the
subject pretty thoroughly, pro and con:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It will be remembered by members of the National
Association that last year the Executive Committee established
a Fellowship in Baking Technology in the University
of Kansas, and that Henry A. Kohman, of Lawrence, Kansas,
was appointed to this position for a term of two years.
The agreement between the association, on one hand, and
the University of Kansas and Mr. Kohman, on the other,
was that Mr. Kohman should devote his time and best attention
in an endeavor to solve some of the chemical problems
which so often perplex the baker, the result of his researches
to be the property of the association, on terms to
be mutually agreed upon.</p></div>

<p>At the February meeting of the Executive Committee,
in Kansas City, Mr. Kohman was present and made a
verbal report on the work so far accomplished by him, and
was instructed to prepare a paper on the subject for publication
in the trade press, which paper is given herewith.
In transmitting his paper Mr. Kohman says that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
spent much time in collecting publications relating to the
science of bread-making, in order to get a thorough understanding
of the whole subject, and that in order to be practical
as well as theoretical he has spent part of his time in
the bakeshop.</p>

<h3>The Use of Malt Extract in Bread-Making.</h3>

<p>When the National Association of Master Bakers made
it possible for me to visit a number of the best bakeries in
this country and Canada, I met with frequent inquiries in
regard to the malt extract question. Some bakers used it
to good advantage, but the majority used little or none.
Looking over the formulas which I obtained through the
kindness of the bakers in these different baking establishments,
I find that only about five or six per cent. of the
bread contains malt extract.</p>


<h3>Practical Experiments.</h3>

<p>In order to throw some light upon this question I
undertook a series of experiments, the result of which I
give below.</p>

<p>Preliminary experiments were made with five different
commercial brands of malt extract. Their reducing-sugar
content and diastatic activity were determined. The percentage
of reducing sugar showed no great variation and
needs no further comment. The diastatic activity, however,
varied considerably. By the diastatic activity is meant the
number of times its (own) weight of maltose a given quantity
of extract will produce when allowed to act upon acid-free
soluble starch for one hour at a temperature of 40 degrees
C. (104 degrees F.).</p>

<p>The activities of the five extracts mentioned above are
as follows: No. 1—8.56, No. 2—15.71, No. 3—8.60, No. 4—9.69,
No. 5—20.13. These results were obtained under similar
conditions, and are, therefore, strictly comparable. It is
quite evident that these extracts have different sugar-producing
values. No. 5, for example, will produce 2.35 times
as much sugar as No. 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>


<h3>Malt Extract vs. Sugar.</h3>

<p>Having determined the relative diastatic values of the
malt extracts, it was desirable to determine their values as
sugar producers in bread-making; and to see if the saccharine
material in bread could not be supplied cheaper by
means of malt extract than by the use of granulated sugar,
as is commonly done. Five different breads were made, all
conditions and ingredients being kept as nearly similar as
possible, except the kind and quantity of saccharine material
used. After the breads were made and dried the percentages
of reducing sugars were determined. The tabulated results
follow:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="diastatic values">
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Grams<br />Flour.</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Saccharine Material.</td><td align="center">P’c’t’ge<br />Sugar<br />Pound.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">No. 3&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">800</td><td align="left">8 gm. malt extract No. 5</td><td align="right">6.00</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">No. 4&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">800</td><td align="left">8 gm. malt extract No. 1</td><td align="right">5.68</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">No. 5&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">800</td><td align="left">1 gm. malt extract No. 5 and 30 gm. cooked flour</td><td align="right">5.27</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The percentages found are calculated on the dry bread.
The results reveal several interesting and significant facts.
The eight grams of the lowest diastatic extract (activity
8.56) produced more sugar in the bread than the twenty
grams of cane sugar. It is also evident that the lowest diastatic
extract produced nearly as much sugar as the highest.
The ratio of their activities is 8.56 to 20.13, while the ratio
of the percentages of sugar produced is only 5.68 to 6.00.
We might expect that the extract with an activity of 20.13
would produce more sugar than the one having an activity
of only 8.56, but the results show that it did not. The explanation
seems to be that both have an activity sufficiently
high to convert into sugar and dextrin all the starch that is
freed from the cellulose by having the cell walls broken, and
neither attacks the starch granules that are still enclosed
by cellulose.</p>

<p>It is a quite significant fact, too, that the one gram Of
malt extract No. 5, together with thirty grams cooked flour,
produced nearly as much sugar in the bread as the twenty
grams of granulated sugar. This bread, No. 5, in addition
to having the sugar supplied in the cheapest way, had its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
moisture and freshness retained longer than the other
breads.</p>

<p>The bread having no saccharine material added showed
on analysis to have 3.64 per cent. of reducing sugar. Some
of this sugar was in the flour, but the larger part of it was
formed by the enzymes in the flour during the fermentation
period and the baking of the bread.</p>

<p>Knowing the percentage of sugar and the weight of dry
bread produced from the 800 grams of flour, I calculated the
amount of sugar in the total quantity of bread produced in
each baking. Then by deducting the amount of sugar in
bread No. 2, which had no sugar added, from the amount in
the other breads, the total amount of sugar produced by the
malt extract was obtained. In this way it was found that the
malt extract No. 5 produced 2.65 times its weight of sugar
when added directly to the dough as is commonly done, and
that it yielded 14.67 times its own weight of sugar when a
portion of the flour was cooked, as in experiment 5; or it
produced 5.5 times as much sugar when added to flour, the
starch of which had been gelatinized by cooking, as it did
when added to the raw flour. The cooked flour was cooled
to 120 degrees F. and then the malt extract added. The
results show that while malt extract produces considerable
sugar when added directly to the raw flour, it produces much
more sugar when a portion of the flour is cooked.</p>

<p>Now, one might suppose that the heat of the oven would
certainly gelatinize a portion of the starch, and thus aid the
diastase in the conversion of the starch into sugar, and avoid
the necessity of cooking a portion of the flour. But when
we consider the fact that the starch does not begin to gelatinize
until the temperature is raised to 152 degrees, which
is already about 30 degrees above the most favorable temperature
for the activity of the diastase, and the fact that
the diastase is killed at a temperature of about 175 degrees
F., we can readily see why the gelatinization of starch in
the oven is of little assistance to the diastase in the conversion
of starch into sugar.</p>

<p>This also throws some light upon the fact that the low
diastatic extract produced approximately as much sugar as
the one having the high activity. As stated above, both of
the extracts, when used to the extent of one per cent., figured
on the flour, have sufficient diastase to convert the broken
starch granules into sugar, and the higher activity then can
be of value only in the conversion of starch into sugar after
gelatinization of a portion of the starch by the heat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
oven, and then only while the temperature rises from 152
degrees F., at which temperature the starch is gelatinized,
until it reaches about 175 degrees, when the diastase is killed,
and under very unfavorable conditions, for the temperature
is far above the most favorable activity of the diastase.</p>

<p>While the high diastatic extract seems to yield but little
more sugar than the one of low activity when added directly
to the raw flour, it has a decided advantage when a portion
of the flour is cooked, for then the amounts of sugar produced
by different extracts will bear much more nearly the
same ratios to each other as the activities of the extracts.</p>

<p>Besides supplying saccharine material in the bread, malt
extract has other advantages. In addition to the sugar it
contains mineral salts, peptones, and other protein materials
which stimulate fermentation. These proteins, besides
being a source of nitrogenous food for the yeast, act upon
the proteins of the flour, making them assimilable by the
yeast.</p>

<p>In addition to the amylolytic ferment, the diastase, which
converts starch into sugar, malt extract contains proteolytic
ferments which act upon the gluten much as the ferments of
the yeast. These ferments aid the yeast in preparing the
gluten, and hence a smaller quantity of yeast can be used
when malt extract takes the place of granulated sugar. In
other words, the dough matures quicker, owing to the presence
of these ferments in the malt extract. While the
extracts with the higher diastatic activity produce only a
little more sugar than the lower diastatic extracts, they act
upon the gluten much more vigorously, and consequently
the dough matures much sooner when a high diastatic malt
is used. This latter, then, is better suited to hard flours,
while the former can be used to good advantage with weak
flours.</p>

<p>The dextrin formed by the diastase gives a very desirable
color to the crust of the bread, which is often lacking
when no malt extract is used. In addition to these advantages,
malt extract produces an agreeable flavor, and this is,
perhaps, one of the best arguments for its use.</p>

<p>From the table above it is evident that a given weight
of malt extract goes much farther toward producing sugar
in bread than does the same weight of cane sugar, but there
has been nothing said of prices. By a few calculations I
think we can show, approximately, how much the baker can
save in dollars and cents by using malt extract in place of
cane sugar. We will assume the flour to be worth $4.50 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
barrel or 2.29 cents per pound, cane sugar 5 cents per pound
and malt extract 7 cents per pound. As a basis of comparison
we will take 100 pounds of cane sugar, which at 5
cents per pound will be worth $5.00. As stated above, one
part of malt extract will produce 2.65 times its weight of
sugar when added to the dough directly and 14.67 times its
weight of sugar when a portion of the flour is cooked. Then
it will take 100 divided by 2.65 equals 37.7 pounds of malt
extract to produce 100 pounds of sugar by the first method.
Since malt extract contains sixty per cent. or more of sugar,
the 37.7 pounds would supply 22.6 pounds of sugar and there
would be used up 77.4 pounds of starch from the flour to
make up the 100 pounds of flour. The 77.4 pounds of flour
at 2.29 cents per pound would cost $1.77 and the 37.7 pounds
malt extract at 7 cents per pound would cost $2.64, making
a total of $4.41 for the 100 pounds of sugar, against $5.00, the
cost of the cane sugar.</p>

<p>By the second method, in which a portion of the flour
was cooked, it would take 100 divided by 14.67 equals 6.81
pounds of malt extract to produce 100 pounds of sugar. This
would contain 4.1 pounds of sugar and there would be used
up 95.9 pounds of starch from the flour to make up the 100
pounds of sugar. The cost of the 6.81 pounds malt extract
would be $0.50 and the cost of the flour $2.20, a total of
$2.70. Then there would be a saving of $5.00 minus 4.41
equals $0.59 by the first method and $5.00 minus $2.70 equals
$2.30 by the second method on every hundred pounds of
cane sugar used. So far we have considered only the saccharine
material. The cane sugar, of course, contains nothing
but saccharine material. The malt extract, however, in
addition to the sugar, contains about seven per cent. of
protein material, which has not been mentioned, and which
is an item of considerable importance, and also mineral salts
which stimulate yeast fermentation. Besides, the malt
extract gives a color to the crust of the bread and a flavor
which is quite desirable. When the starch of the flour is
converted into sugar, the gluten remains and makes the
bread that much richer in protein, which is one of the essential
constituents of white bread; also it absorbs several times
its weight of water and thus increases the yield of the bread.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that there are many points to be considered
in connection with the use of malt extract in bread
baking. Most of the evidences, however, seem to indicate
that it can be used to good advantage. The principle that
“If a little is good, more is better,” will not apply, however.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Two pounds to the barrel may give splendid results, while
four pounds to the barrel may cause a miserable, soggy loaf
of bread. The amounts that can be successfully used depend
upon the strength of the flour and the diastatic activity of
the extract. With a weak flour one must use low diastatic
extracts, while with strong flours one may use larger quantities
of extracts with a greater diastatic power.</p>

<h2>COTTON SEED OIL IN
BREAD-MAKING<br />

<span class="subtitle">BY DAVID CHIDLOW</span></h2>


<p>Cotton seed oil has received so much attention from
bread makers in the past few years that it would seem there
was nothing left unsaid regarding its advantages in bread-making;
but thoughtful bakers will be alert to learn anything
new regarding the properties of oil for shortening,
which will make them better bakers by using shortenings,
with an understanding of their properties in bread-making.</p>


<h3>Why Are Shortenings Used?</h3>

<p>Shortenings are used in bread-making to accomplish
certain definite results, the most common being: first, the
coating of each little cell in the loaf whereby the moisture
is retained in the loaf, preventing its escape exactly in the
manner that waxed or oiled paper would prevent the escape
of moisture from a loaf around which it was wrapped. Cut
a good loaf after it has been baked about twelve hours,
examine it in full daylight, and notice the sheen reflected
from each rounded cell. This sheen is greater in loaves
which have been properly fermented, using the right proportion
of shortening, than in the loaves where the shortening
was either deficient in amount or of improper character.
Of this matter we will say more further on. Secondly, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
use of shortening whitens the bread. Thirdly, a part of the
shortening combines with the gluten to make it elastic, and
thereby expands more readily and makes a reasonably large
loaf. All of these points you can test very readily by making
up small batches, using 100 ounces of flour. Take a reasonably
good spring wheat patent flour and use 6 pounds 4
ounces of flour, 1½ ounces of yeast, 1½ ounces of salt, 2
ounces of sugar and 3 pounds 12 ounces of water, taking the
water at such a temperature so that you will have the dough
at 84. Make up the dough and place it in a wooden pail,
previously oiled, then cover the dough. At the end of two
hours take the dough out and fold it over two or three times.
At the end of three hours do the same thing again; again
at three and one-half hours. See that dough temperature is
maintained as near 84 as possible. At four hours scale it
off into sizes for your pan, and prove about sixty minutes
in a proving chamber having a temperature of 90.</p>

<p>So far I have said nothing about the quantity of oil to
be used. This is because I want you to realize what an
influence the amount of shortening has on dough and its
expansion. In one dough of the size given above use 1
ounce of oil; in another use 2 ounces; in the third use 3
ounces. Add the oil to the sugar and salt, rub down
smoothly until it is a creamy mass; then add a little of the
water and a little of the flour and rub down again. Do this
with each of the doughs so that the oil will be uniformly
mixed in the dough. You will note that the texture of the
loaf containing the least amount of shortening is broken.
The loaf will not really stand the amount of proof that is
given to it, because the gluten will not stretch sufficiently
to hold in the gas. The loaf containing the 2 ounces of
shortening will be improved very much, and the one containing
the 3 ounces will not only be improved in texture and
appearance, but will retain the moisture very much longer,
as you will find, if you will put a loaf from each of the
doughs aside for two days, weighing before and after
standing.</p>


<h3>Each Shortening in Its Proper Place.</h3>

<p>In a number of experiments at Chidlow Institute, Chicago,
seven years ago, it was found that every kind of fat
that could be used in bread-making had a character of its
own which it exhibited in various ways. In fact, they varied
so widely as to suggest much deeper research than was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
first contemplated at that time. In making up a number of
doughs, small amounts of each shortening was added to the
loaves, increasing the amount until a proportion of 40
pounds per barrel of flour was used, the lowest amount of
shortening used being 2 pounds per barrel of flour. The
loaves from each of these batches were placed aside with
a view of finding out how much of the shortening was
brought to the outside of the loaf by escape of the moisture,
and it was found that nearly all shortenings came to the
surface or crust of the loaf in different proportions. These
tests were made many times over, and always with the
same results. With some shortenings the amount of fat
brought out was nearly one-half of what was added; in
others it would be less than one-fourth, and in some it was
as high as three-fourths. Evidently the shortening that
would carry three-fourths of the quantity to the crust was
unfitted for bread-making by that particular method and
with that particular flour.</p>

<p>The details of these experiments are of no service here.
They are only referred to as indicating a difference of result
obtained by the use of different shortenings. The same
thing was noted in making experimental doughs. These
were made of the same weight of flour, yeast, sugar, shortening,
and water. They were then placed in a glass jar
which was marked off so as to give clear readings of the
expansion of each dough. The jars were then placed in a
water bath maintained at a uniform temperature, and covered
with glass to keep the surface of the dough moist. Some
of the shortenings used permitted the doughs to rise very
much higher than where other shortenings were used, and
it made no difference how often these doughs were made
and the tests repeated. The shortenings that permitted a
very high expansion of the dough on one test always gave
a high expansion in another test, so that the results were
uniform. This gave us the very information we were in
search of, showing us that we must find the best method for
each kind of shortening, and for each kind of flour.</p>


<h3>Best Method of Using Cotton Seed Oil.</h3>

<p>The following instructions are based upon a part of
these experiments under the following specific conditions:
In the first place it must be understood that a method of
making bread is best suited for a particular flour, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
alteration of flour usually requires an alteration in the
method, or at least a modification of the method. Many of
the spring wheat patent flours being sold are second patents,
and as such they are best made into doughs by use of
sponges. Take, then, spring wheat second patent flour and
a four to six hour sponge. One-half of the total oil should
be used in the sponge and the other half in the dough. This
brings shortening in accomplishing the expansion of the loaf,
in giving a clear whiteness to the loaf, and a bright sheeny
coating of the cells making up the structure of the loaf. The
average amount of shortening used for pan bread in the
United States is five pounds per barrel of flour. Assuming
this proportion, then, at least one-half pound of shortening
can be discarded without any loss of the shortening power.</p>

<p>The foregoing instructions are not applicable to other
flours than of the type given, nor can they be used properly
with straight doughs.—<i>Cotton Seed.</i></p>

<h2>CORN FLAKES USED IN
BREAD</h2>

<p>Corn flakes are made from the starchy part of the maize
kernel. The starch of corn itself has little value for the
bread baker in its crude form. It is insoluble in cold water,
and can only be dissolved by the disintegration of the organized
structures of the granules.</p>

<p>On being boiled with water it forms a gelatinous looking
mass, and dissolves.</p>

<p>When examined after boiling the starch granules are
seen to have broken up, a small part remaining in the liquid
as minute insoluble particles.</p>

<p>In this condition starch is very susceptible to the action
of the bodies known as ferments.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, this same change takes place in
the process employed in the manufacture of corn flakes, that
is, the crude starch granules have become completely gelatinized.</p>

<p>The value of gelatinized starch as formed in corn flakes,
especially when used in connection with a small quantity of
malt extract or malt flour, is not sufficiently understood by
many bakers, and it is hoped that these few remarks will
make the matter clearer and be of interest to all bakers
who are desirous to increase their knowledge in the works
of their chosen vocation.</p>

<p>It has conclusively been shown in text-books, that cooked
starch, i. e., corn flakes, are more susceptible to “saccharification,”
that is, sugar is sometimes called saccharum or saccharine
matter, hence the term which is applied to this
change that the starch thus undergoes. This conversion
is due to the ferment known as diastase found in malt and
has the power to convert the gelatinized starches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
corn flakes into maltose. Maltose, on the other hand, is
changed by the ferment zymose, contained in yeast, into
glucose.</p>

<p>This body is of interest to the baker as being the ultimate
form to which all sugars are changed, and in this
state is readily broken down into carbonic acid gas and
alcohol, which causes doughs to rise. It follows then that
corn flakes are a very valuable article to the baker on account
of its gelatinized starch, its low cost, absolute sterility,
its purity, and, above all, its great moisture-absorbing
qualities.</p>

<p>Its use in connection with malt may eliminate the use
of cane sugar entirely, and still furnish all the saccharine necessary
to give bread the desired sweet flavor and taste. In
order to make this clear, the result of the following experiments
will corroborate the above statement. After the
bread was baked and dried and ground the quantities of reducing
sugar were determined by chemical test:</p>

<p>No. 1—100 gm. flour, 58 c. c. water, 2.5 gm. cane sugar
gave 5.5 gm. saccharine.</p>

<p>No. 2—100 gm. flour, 56 c. c. water, no cane sugar, gave
3.9 gm. saccharine.</p>

<p>No. 3—100 gm. flour, 62 c. c. water, .125 gm. malt, 3
gm. corn flakes, gave 5.4 gm. saccharine.</p>

<p>The different quantities of water were increased to give
dough equal viscosity.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, in making comparisons from
this table, that the saccharine matter in the bread is produced
in one instance, by the action of the diastase contained
in the malt extract, in the other by the action of the enzymes
in the flour upon the partial disrupted starch granules of
the flour itself, and in the third instance by the cane sugar
used.</p>

<p>The results obtained from these experiments are interesting
and worthy of careful consideration, inasmuch as
⅛ gm. of malt with 3 gm. of corn flakes (perfectly gelatinized
starch) produced practically as much saccharine matter
as when 2½ gm. of cane sugar was used. In other words
furnishes the bread sufficient saccharine matter at the least
possible cost. In addition to this the corn flakes absorbed
twice its weight of moisture in the dough, thereby increasing
bulk, a decided gain to the baker.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument, it is admitted that the same
chemical action takes place when using any other highly
starchy product which has been cooked. Corn flakes, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
eliminates any necessity for previous boiling, since it is
already prepared in its manufacture and is very sensitive
to the attack of diastasic action.</p>

<p>It is also a fact that some of the starch in the flour,
which has become disrupted during the milling, is gelatinized
by the heat of the oven during baking, giving diastase
opportunity to convert some of the starch into sugar.
But since raw starch does not gelatinize until the temperature
has reached 150 degrees F., which temperature is
already higher than the most favorable one for diastasic action,
and the intervening time during which the temperature
of the baking is increased to 175 degrees F. (a killing temperature
for diastase), is very short, a relatively small
amount of the gelatinized starch is converted and the baker
therefore is compelled to add the more costly article, cane
sugar, in order to produce the desired amount of saccharine
matter in his bread. This fully explains the difference of
saccharine matter found in experiments No. 2 and No. 3.</p>

<p>It further shows that bread containing gelatinized starch
as found in corn flakes is fully as good a sugar producer as
when using cane sugar, and, as before said, at the smallest
possible cost.</p>

<p>To produce the maximum amount of sugar from corn
flakes the proportions of malt extract and corn flakes as
given, should be mixed in about two gallons of tepid water
for each barrel of flour to be made into dough at a temperature
of about 140 degrees F. Allow it to remain at this constant
temperature for 1½ hours. In this time nearly all of the
gelatinized starch of the corn flakes has become converted
into maltose. In practice this would show that if 100 lbs.
of cane sugar at a cost of $5 be used in bread work the same
saccharine matter could be supplanted by using 116 lbs.
of corn flake, a price of about $3.50 plus 18c worth of malt,
making a total cost of $3.68, and shows a saving of $1.32
where 100 lbs. of sugar is employed.</p>

<p>Corn flakes, besides furnishing saccharine matter, has
other advantages. It contains some mineral salts and proteids
which are very acceptable nitrogenous foods and readily
assimilated by the yeast, causing a rapid and vigorous fermentation.</p>

<p>They also prepare and soften the gluten, giving to the
doughs that much desired velvety feeling, and the maximum
expansion in the oven. Corn flakes and malt extract
may also be used as a short ferment and makes it possible
to decrease the amount of yeast usually used without affecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the quality of the bread.</p>

<p>A formula for pan bread which has been used for years
and is giving good results is as follows:</p>

<p>Water, 1 qt.; malt extract, .40 oz.; salt, 1 oz.; corn
flakes. 1 oz.; lard, 1.75 oz.; yeast, .33 oz.; dry milk, .75 oz.;
flour, 3 lbs. 7 oz.</p>

<p>Of course, this can be increased to any amount.</p>

<p>The directions are: Take ⅛ part of the water to be used
at temperature of 82 degrees F. and in it dissolve the corn
flakes, malt extract and yeast. Let this stand 20 minutes to
ferment. It will have risen considerably in this time and
fallen; then add it to the balance of the ingredients and
make dough.</p>

<p>Corn flakes give color to the crust, is an absorber of
moisture, retains it and keeps bread fresh, and inasmuch as
it has no pronounced flavor of its own will not predominate
or cover up the flavor obtained from good wheat flour and
correct fermentation.</p>

<p>This would indicate a third good quality of corn flakes,
that is, used simply as a filler for its value as a water absorber
only.</p>

<p>While the above tables indicate the use of 6 lbs. of corn
flakes to a barrel of flour, satisfactory results have been
achieved when 10 lbs. have been added per barrel of flour.</p>

<p>Much depends, however, where corn flakes are used
simply as a filler, upon the strength of the flour.</p>

<p>To conclude, I have tried to show that corn flakes can
be used in three different ways.</p>

<p>First as a sugar producer, secondly as a yeast saver,
and thirdly as a means to increase bulk and leave it to each
individual baker to adopt either method, and trust to have
been instrumental in telling something that may be of value,
if not to every baker, at least to some.</p>

<h2>POTATO FLOUR AND
BREAD</h2>


<p>Potato flour is a yeast food. It contains gelatinized
starch, sugar, dextim amides and mineral matter, all of the
bodies are yeast nutrients, the first-named being converted
into sugar by a ferment in the yeast. The analysis of pure
imported potato flour should approximately show as follows:
Water, 10.69 per cent.; protein, 6.59 per cent; fat, 0.23
per cent; nutritious extractive matter, 78.73 per cent; fibre,
1.18 per cent; ash, 2.58 per cent, making in all a total of 100
per cent.</p>

<p>The extractive matter is mostly carbo-hydrates (sugar).
The ash, the mineral matter, mostly phosphates.</p>

<p>We have here three important bodies for yeast production—carbo-hydrates,
protein and phosphates, and the last
two, moreover, act as powerful stimulants. Owing to these
facts, the writer thinks a closer acquaintance about the use
of potato flour will be of some interest to the progressive
bread baker.</p>

<p>It is often said that formerly, before the introduction of
compressed yeast, when potato ferments were mostly used,
that bread was superior in flavor and keeping qualities than
most of the bread baked at present.</p>

<p>Furthermore, bakers of to-day find it absolutely necessary
to add large quantities of sugar, lard and often milk to
their dough to overcome the effect that compressed yeast
has brought about. It is not the writer’s intention to belittle
the value of compressed yeast, as this product is now
an inseparable commodity in the bakeshop.</p>

<p>It is, however, possible to get back the advantages obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
from the old potato ferment process by the judicious
use of pure potato flour.</p>

<p>It eliminates entirely the old cumbersome method of
boiling and mashing potatoes, scalding flour and setting
away the ferment until ready for use, for five or six hours.
Pure potato flour used in connection with a small quantity
of diastasic malt extract will accomplish results gratifying
to the baker and assist in cutting down cost of production.</p>

<p>In the first place, the diastasic power of the malt extracts
converts the carbo-hydrates of the potato flour into maltose,
and if this is carried in far enough produces more than
enough saccharine matter for any dough. Secondly, the extractive
and mineral matter of potato flour gives great assistance
to the raising properties of yeast by stimulating and
increasing yeast cells in a medium befitting their propagation
according to the laws of nature. While this may
seem clear in theory, any baker can easily ascertain the
above bespoken values of potato flour by practical tests.
The following formula will be sufficient to guide the baker
to make any size test he contemplates to make for a straight
dough: 1 qt. water, .08 oz. malt extract, 1 oz. potato flour,
.75 oz. lard, 1 oz. salt, .33 oz. yeast, 3 lb. 5 oz. spring patent
flour. For a barrel of flour this would equal 15 gals. water,
7 oz. malt extract, 3¾ lbs. potato flour, 3 lbs. lard, 3½ lbs.
salt, 1¼ lbs. yeast, 196 lbs. flour.</p>

<p>Weigh the potato flour into a clean tub, pour 4 gals.
of water, at 90 degrees F., in, also the 7 oz. of malt extract,
and mix up; then break into it the yeast and see to it that
it is all dissolved. Cover up with a clean bag. Now get all
your other ingredients into the mixer or trough, the balance
of the water, your salt and lard scaled off, and your
barrel of flour ready. By this time your ferment in the tub
will have risen, and be on the point of falling. It is then
ready to mix all together and dough. The water should be
tempered so as to bring the dough out between 82 and 85
degrees F.</p>

<p>Mix the dough well until clear. Allow it to stand and
give it full proof before knocking down first time, which will
take about 3½ hours. When it has come up again about
three-quarters proof knock down again. Give it another
one-half proof in the trough and your dough should be
ready to take; in all, 5½ to 6 hours. You will find that
potato flour makes your bread keep moist. It will give a
rich nutty flavor and will give a much larger yield on account
of its moisture, absorbing qualities, and on the whole make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a very satisfactory loaf. This, in the writer’s estimation, is
the best way to use potato flour in order to get best results
at lowest cost of production.</p>

<p>Potato flour may be used dry. When making straight
dough this way the potato flour must always be sifted into
the flour dry. The quantity to use varies according to
strength of the flour and the baker’s own ideas, say 4 to 6
pounds for each barrel of flour. Without changing your
usual formula, except cutting some of sugar and increasing
water, it will produce good bread.</p>

<p>If the potato flour is scalded and then cooled before
using it will assist such as want to get a solid home-made
loaf.</p>

<p>No other ingredient, to the writer’s knowledge, will
produce bread that will compare in flavor and texture with
the old style potato ferment bread than when employing
pure imported potato flour judiciously, according to any of
the above methods described, nor can any bread be made,
considering quality, cheaper or as cheap.</p>

<h2>FERMENTATION</h2>

<h3>A Few Remarks by E. Wilfahrt, an Authority Upon the
Subject</h3>


<p>The term fermentation, as applied to baking, we find first
described as a form of spontaneous decay, changing the
carbohydrates contained in the dough into alcohol and dioxide
gas. Such fermentation is termed alcoholic. Other
varieties of fermentation also exist during the process of
doughing, and are termed lactic, acetous, viscous and
putrefactive.</p>

<p>The process of fermentation which has for its object the
manufacture of bread must be of alcoholic nature, containing
½ of 1 per cent. acidity in proportions of 95 per cent. lactic
and 5 per cent. acetic. The presence of lactic fermentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
softens the gluten, while the presence of acetic fermentation
causes a larger expansion of the loaf.</p>

<p>Of course, the larger the percentage of the acetic acid
in proportion to the lactic acid, the larger would be the
ultimate expansion of the finished loaf; that is, if no excessive
percentage of acidity is produced. While the presence
of acetic acid in minute proportions acts favorably on the
expansion of the loaf, an excess of it must result in sour
bread. Consequently, the acids contained in their proper
proportions in the fermented dough exert a beneficial influence,
both as to the flavor of the bread and assistance in
fermentation.</p>

<p>Viscous fermentation produces the much dreaded disease
“rope in bread,” and is really the beginning of putrefaction
of the raw material employed. This trouble is
caused by over-acidity in the dough and heat, or by uncleanliness,
which generates over-acidity, or excess growth of
microbes, and this causes rope in bread.</p>

<p>Putrefaction means decomposition of materials employed.
It is a non-alcoholic ferment, and the material undergoing
putrefaction always gives out a decidedly bad odor.</p>

<p>In making a dough the first point to consider, after
proper ingredients have been selected, is the temperature of
the dough and of the proving room. The utmost care should
be exercised to keep the dough room at a uniform temperature.
The best temperature for dough is 78 degrees F., after
mixing, and the temperature of the shop should be about 82
degrees F.</p>

<p>To keep a dough thus made at the proper temperature
during the period of fermentation it is necessary to use salt
in the proper proportions to the amount of sugar and shortening
added in the mixing of the dough. So that the rising
acidity during the process of fermentation may be properly
neutralized salt is used, first to govern the fermentation, and
secondly, to give the bread the necessary flavor. Although
it is generally conceded that salt retards fermentation,
nevertheless this action is most powerful on non-alcoholic
ferments. Consequently, salt, if used in the proper proportion,
really acts as a stimulant to produce a healthy dough,
or perfect loaf of bread.</p>

<p>My experience has taught me that for plain white bread
three ounces of salt to a gallon of water is the proper
amount. For each two ounces of sugar and shortening
added to a gallon of water, one-quarter ounce of salt should
be correspondingly added, until four ounces of salt are used
to the gallon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a dough, therefore, will call for one-half pound
each of sugar and shortening and four ounces of salt to each
gallon of water. This would make a very rich home-made
dough with a large yield, on account of its moisture retaining
power.</p>

<p>In adding more than one-half pound each of sugar and
shortening to the gallon, as in making rolls and sweet
doughs, the amount of salt must be reduced one-quarter of
an ounce for each additional two ounces of sugar, and shortening
added to the gallon, until two ounces of salt is all that
remains to be used to the gallon of water. From this limit
only one-eighth of an ounce is deducted for each additional
two ounces of sugar and shortening added.</p>

<p>The amount of flour added to the gallon of liquid depends
upon the class of bread to be made. It averages 12½
to 15 pounds to the gallon.</p>

<p>Malt extract is one of the best acquisitions in the manufacture
of bread, as it is very useful in increasing the keeping
qualities of the product, and gives a better flavor to the
loaf, such as is produced by the use of milk.</p>

<p>The shortening should be added after the dough is
thoroughly incorporated with the balance of ingredients, as
if added first, it will not give the desired results and the
flour will not absorb the same quantity of water, as if the
shortening were added last.</p>

<p>The temperature of the bakeshop during the operation
of molding is another important feature. The dough room
should be kept at as uniform a temperature as possible, as
the dough is very susceptible to changes of temperature.</p>

<p>In some bakeries the water used is hard, while in other
shops soft water is used. The character of the water used
has as much to do with the fermentation as the temperature
of the water. The softer the water the quicker the fermentation.
Generally speaking, dough should never be made
without the use of a thermometer to insure uniformity day
after day. All ingredients used should be carefully weighed,
then the so-called ill-luck in the shop will be a thing of rare
occurrence.</p>

Pie Baking</h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 62px;">

</div>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a><br /><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<h2>PIE BAKING</h2>


<h2>STANDARD RECIPES</h2>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 qts. Fresh Fruit.</li>
<li>1 qt. Water.</li>
<li>1½ lb. Sugar.</li>
<li>2 oz. Corn Starch.</li>
<li>½ oz. Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above formula is adapted to the following pies:
Apple, peach, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, gooseberry,
huckleberry, currant and rhubarb. For the apple, peach and
currant pies use 1 oz. of corn starch instead of 2 oz. For
the rhubarb pie use only 1 pt. of water and about a half
pound less sugar. From 1 to ½ oz. of spice is added to
the apple and peach mixture.</p>

<p>When green fruit is used it should be boiled about 2
minutes. Rhubarb requires more time. Dried and evaporated
fruit should also be boiled for a few minutes. If the
fruit is not boiled it will run and stick to the plate.</p>

<p>After boiling, add the sugar and flavor and mix thoroughly.
The corn starch may be omitted if desired. Before
placing pies in oven wash lightly with milk or egg wash.</p>


<h3>Pie Crust.</h3>

<p>Use 2 lbs. lard and 4 lbs. of flour. Rub together lightly
but thoroughly. The whole secret of a good crust is just
the proper mixing. If worked too hard the result is poor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Furthermore, great care should be taken not to put in too
much water. This is very important. Cotton oil, butter or
other shortening may be used instead of the lard. Pies are
better if the filling is put in cold. Always keep the shortening
in the ice box before using.</p>


<h3>Custard Pie.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ lb. Sugar.</li>
<li>25 Eggs.</li>
<li>½ lb. Flour.</li>
<li>6 qts. Milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Add a little salt. If desired corn starch may be used
instead of flour. This pie is filled in the oven.</p>


<h3>Lemon Pie.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 qts. Water.</li>
<li>4 lbs. Sugar.</li>
<li>10 Eggs.</li>
<li>1 doz. Lemons.</li>
<li>¾ lb. Corn Starch.</li>
</ul>

<p>The corn starch may be omitted if desired. Some use
about ½ a pound of lard and butter.</p>


<h3>Rhubarb Pie.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. Rhubarb.</li>
<li>1½ lbs. Sugar.</li>
<li>Corn Starch as desired.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rhubarb should be cut in small pieces after it is
peeled and allowed to stand over night with the sugar.
Strain off juice and boil for a minute, then add the rhubarb
and let boil for 2 or 3 minutes. The corn starch is frequently
omitted.</p>


<h3>Pumpkin Pie.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. Mashed Pumpkin.</li>
<li>1 lb. Sugar.</li>
<li>8 Eggs.</li>
<li>4 oz. Flour.</li>
<li>2 qts. Milk.</li>
<li>Salt, ginger and cinnamon.</li>
</ul>

<p>When cooked, drain pumpkins dry and mash thoroughly.
Add sugar, ginger, etc. Mix flour and milk and add this to
the pumpkin. See that the mixture is smooth and without
lumps. This pie is filled in the oven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<h3>Mince Meat.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 lbs. Currants.</li>
<li>1 lb. Suet.</li>
<li>8 lbs. Apples.</li>
<li>12 lbs. Beef.</li>
<li>3 lbs. Sugar.</li>
<li>4 lbs. Raisins.</li>
<li>1 pt. Brandy.</li>
<li>2 pts. Cider.</li>
<li>4 oz. Allspice.</li>
<li>4 oz. Cloves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Variations of the above are made in many ways. Some
add citron and 1 or 2 qts. of molasses. About 1 oz. of
pepper may also be used. Lemon and orange peel is frequently
used. Tripe is sometimes substituted for beef. If
desired a little cinnamon or nutmeg may be added.</p>

<h2>GOOD PIE AND PIE FILLING<br />

<span class="subtitle">By Richard Voigt, Terre Haute, Ind.</span></h2>


<p>The first profit in pie lays in the filler, or thickness for
the fruit. The public prefers a full pie, and without the
so-called filler; you cannot make a full pie and sell it at a
profit. So many use corn starch to thicken; this has a corn
taste and makes the filling of a tough nature, and the second
day the pie looks flat and unsalable. Others use cake
crumbs; this is really the worst, as old laid-over cakes are
more or less rancid, the many materials the cake was formerly
compounded from does not flavor the good taste of a
pie. My way of making filler is as follows: I take Pearl
tapioca, have same ground to fine meal like corn meal. The
cost of this is 4½ cents per pound, and ¾ of a cent per
pound to grind it—for general use I take 12 qts. of water, 2
lbs. of tapioca, 6 lbs. of sugar, put all in a kettle on the
fire, and stir until the milky appearance disappears, when
the mixture is done; this should never boil, only become of
glassy appearance; this is absolutely tasteless, and really
conducts the most delicate flavor of any fruit. This mixture
costs a little more than 1 cent per pound.</p>

<p>Next take a reasonable amount of this so-called filler
and mix it with any canned fruit, thereby holding the filler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
together, and cheaper at the same time. I use 8 lbs. of
large seeded raisins, 6 qts. water, 10 oz. tapioca and 4 lbs.
sugar. Put the water, tapioca and sugar on the fire and
treat as before said, until it becomes clear. Next add your
raisins, and if you want to make it real good, squeeze to it
a couple of lemons, let all of it cool and you will have a
filling at the cost of 3 cents per pound.</p>

<p>Raspberries make the best berry pies, made of dry berries,
and is made such: Take 14 qts. water, 5 lbs. evaporated
raspberries, boil them a few minutes, then add 6 lbs. sugar
and 2 lbs. tapioca and finish on the fire; this filling costs 4
cents per pound.</p>

<p>So many others can easily be made by applying my
method. There is only one thing to be observed; this is a
little accurate labor. Weigh everything and have your kettles
clean; copper kettles are best.</p>

<p>Further, you must try out such suggestions to find out
whether or not they are what you want.</p>


<h3>Pie Crust and Paste.</h3>

<p>I will say a few words about making pie crust or pie
paste. To make an ordinary cheap, good crust, you must
weigh your flour and lard, and dissolve the salt in the water,
and be sure to know how much water it takes to mix the
dough so you may pour in the full amount at once, thereby
saving the over-working of the dough. Ordinary winter
flour takes 1 qt. water, 4 lbs. flour, 2 lbs. lard, 1 oz. salt.
Many bakers have trouble with watery custard pie. This
is caused from baking too long. A custard pie is baked as
soon as it is firm, no matter what color it may be, and must
be taken from the oven. Often times it is the fault of the
milk (fresh cow milk, I mean); therefore, I made good use
of the dry milk. This dry milk helps to thicken the custard,
makes the pie sweeter and firmer. If you mix 4 lbs. sugar,
1 lb. lard, or butter, in a bowl, add 2 qts. of egg yolks, then
2 lbs. spring flour, 1 lb. dry milk, you will have a regular
dough. Now, gradually add 10 qts. of water, and next fill
your pie bottom in the oven with a dipper; this will make a
firm and sweet custard and bakes much faster than the corn
starch custard. I don’t like corn-starch for pie work. My
experience is that starch settles oftentimes and is too heavy.
Flour dissolves in the liquid moisture. This, however, is a
fancy or experiment and not a real fact in every case.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>


<h3>HEATING OVENS<br />

<span class="subtitle">BY PROF. E. W. HABERMAAS</span></h3>

<p>Proceed to heat the oven as follows: Free the grate of
ashes and clinkers, then put the wood (which should be thoroughly
dry) in the furnace; then put some paper in the furnace
and light it; then open the damper and the draft door.
When using coal for fuel, put some dry wood in the furnace,
then put coal on it and light it, then draw the damper and open
the bottom draft door. Now watch your fire, adding fresh fuel.
When about one-third of the fuel is burned, fill the furnace with
as much fuel as it will hold, then close the door; continue this
process about three times. When the last furnace of fuel has
burned down about one-half, close the damper partly (to prevent
the heat from escaping through the open flue) and as the fire
continues to burn down, continue closing the damper, and when
the fire has burned down completely, close the damper entirely
and shut the bottom draft door. The oven should be fired
at least one hour before you begin baking in it, to allow the
heat to moderate and to become evenly distributed throughout
the oven, producing what is known to the trade as a ground
heat. If you bake in a freshly heated oven your goods will
scorch on the outside and remain doughy inside. Some goods require
a very quick oven, but the first heat in a fresh oven (providing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the oven has been properly heated) is almost too hot for
any class of goods. If you are compelled to bake in a freshly
heated oven, open the damper and allow the oven door to remain
open while baking, thus allowing a portion of the excessive
heat to pass into the flue. This first heat is called flash
heat, because it is not a lasting heat. An oven may be overheated
or underheated to a degree as to render it unfit for service.
Bakers should be very careful about heating their ovens.
Little fuel can be used and excellent results obtained, providing
the one who does the firing knows how to fire an oven. Follow
our directions very carefully when firing ovens. If you have
too much heat in your oven you can remedy that by drawing
the dampers and leaving the oven door open. But if you have
an underheated oven you will find that the only remedy is to
build more fire. This is wasteful extravagance, though sometimes
it is difficult to avoid, especially when you have damp or
green wood. There is also a flash heat in an underheated oven,
but it is not intense, nor does it last very long.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the bottom draft and furnace doors
are not air tight, though you have them closed and have the
dampers open, and only a moderate breeze is blowing, the fire
will burn briskly. If you want the fire to die, close the damper
and the bottom draft door. When you close the damper and
the bottom draft door you shut off the supply completely, or
the life of fire, then it dies. Chimneys should be built to tower
above the roofs of adjoining buildings, so that the air currents
can pass over them unobstructed.</p>

<p>We have shown above that it is necessary to supply fire
with air to create combustion, so we will now show what is
understood by combustion.</p>

<p>Combustion is defined: “To burn, or burning. The process
by which bodies combine with oxygen and are thus seemingly
destroyed. Oxygen exists uncombined in the atmosphere to the
extent of 22 per cent. by volume and more than 23 per cent. by
weight.” The fact that air (and plenty of it) is absolutely
necessary to produce combustion, seems foreign to most people
who fire ovens, etc. These people poke a fire and give it draft as
a matter of fact, but do not know why. All highly flammable
material, such as pitch tar, resin, pine wood, paper, coal oil,
gasolene, etc., and even gas will not burn unless mixed with
a certain per cent. of air or oxygen, and all so-called inflammable
(fire proof) material, such as mineral wood, prepared felt,
asbestos, iron, steel, etc., can be entirely consumed by fire if subject
to sufficient blast. Under ordinary conditions, so-called
fire-proof material will not burn, but throw them into a blast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
furnace—one equipped with a powerful blower—and watch the
results. In a short space of time you will find nothing left
to indicate that such material had been thrown into the furnace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The above illustration is given simply to show what a
necessary factor air is to produce combustion even in a limited
degree. Not only is air necessary to produce combustion, but the
more air or draft you give a fire the more perfect the combustion,
and the more perfect the combustion, the greater the heat
it produces, and the greater the heat produced, the less fuel is
required. Air is less expensive than either wood or coal; bear
this in mind and profit by it. You have learned the necessity
of using the poker frequently, and you have learned what is
meant by draft and combustion. Now be guided by what you
have learned.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go into detail about the construction of
continuous baking ovens, nor of the firing of these ovens. The
builders of such ovens will furnish you the necessary information
when you get ready to purchase such an oven. Enough is
said when we say that more fuel is required to heat a continuous
baking oven than furnace ovens, because the fire does not
get inside of the oven proper (the baking chamber), but encircles
it. The heat must pass through the brick before it enters
the baking chamber. For this reason more fuel is required to
heat the oven. But after you have the required temperature in
your oven, and begin to bake in it, but little fuel is required to
keep it at the regular temperature during the baking period.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Proceed to fire continuous baking ovens same as you would
furnace ovens, and when you have the temperature in the oven
as required, close the damper partly and the bottom draft entirely,
and put on fuel only when necessary, that is when the
temperature begins to fall during the baking period. When the
temperature begins to fall, open the bottom draft and also the
damper and poke the fire frequently. It is not absolutely necessary
to keep up the fire after your oven has the required temperature,
unless your work requires it. In large bake shops where
large batches of bread are baked continuously, it is absolutely
necessary to keep up the fire, but in small shops this is not necessary
unless a larger variety of goods are made; in that case it
would be best to keep up a low fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>


<h3>Preparing Ovens for the Baking Process.</h3>

<p>This applies to furnace ovens only, because the fire enters the
baking chamber. The flames as they circulate around the oven
carry with them more or less ashes, and scatter them over the
hearth. This necessitates cleaning the oven before it can be
used, especially when baking bread on the hearth. A mop or
“swab” is used for this purpose. This mop or “swab” consists
of a long pole, on the end of which a cloth or gunny sack is
fastened. An old peel handle may be used for this purpose or
you can purchase a swab pole from any supply house. Proceed
to swab the oven as follows: Dip the cloth into a vessel of
clean water and get it thoroughly wet, then put it into the oven
and push it back as far as possible and let the pole rest on the
hearth, then take hold of the pole with both hands and bear
down on it so as to raise the cloth slightly to allow it to whirl
around freely, then draw it out about 1½ feet with a rotary motion;
then push it back again; do this quickly. By pushing the
pole forward and drawing it back with the rotary motion, you
cause the cloth to whirl around and throw the ashes or dust
forward towards the oven door. Continue this process, beginning
at the back of the oven and working forward to the oven
door, then take out the swab and put it on the rack; then take
a broom and sweep out the dust or ashes.</p>

<p>While swabbing the oven you raise considerable dust, therefore
it is necessary that the damper should be open to allow
the dust to pass into the flue. Usually while swabbing the oven
the atmosphere in the oven is thick with dust and if the damper
were closed this dust would settle on the hearth; but by keeping
the damper open during this period most of the dust is drawn
into the flue. When the atmosphere in the oven is clear (free
from dust), close the damper and the oven door. Your oven
is now ready for the baking process, but I would advise you not
to bake in the oven immediately after it has been heated, unless
it is absolutely necessary, because the first heat in an oven is
usually intense.</p>

<h2>FLOUR AND WHAT FLOUR
WILL PRODUCE<br />

<span class="subtitle">BY F. D. EMMONS, MINNEAPOLIS</span></h2>


<p>Bread-baking is becoming more and more each year a
manufacturing process. Gradually the baker is introducing
improved machines and improving his process of making
bread by the introduction of new methods. Bread-baking
has reached the stage where the process can be operated
throughout practically by machinery.</p>

<p>The bakers operating the smaller bakeries usually have
a mixer and molding machine. A few years ago even bakeries
of large capacity did not have even these machines. The
baker has come to see that a larger knowledge of the proper
conditions of baking and what takes place during the process
of bread-baking gives him better bread.</p>

<p>In going through the bakeries of the United States, we
find the uppermost question in mind of the master baker is
“QUALITY.” His constant endeavor is to make a better lot
of bread. The people of the United States are receiving a
better loaf of bread each year, as the increase in the sale
of baker’s bread testifies.</p>

<p>There is still room for improvement, however. The
baker’s difficulties are not only encountered through the
ingredients used in bread-making. In fact, these cause only
a small part of his troubles. The baker not only has to be
a baker and understand baking thoroughly, but he must also
be a weather prophet. Weather conditions affect bread-making
more than any other conditions which arise. There
are very few bakeries having absolute control of their dough
room. To have uniform bread each day it is necessary to
have control of the dough room. There are very few who
realize the importance of controlling these factors. I would
like to leave this one message—“Watch Your Dough Room.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>


<h3>Flour Storage.</h3>

<p>To have flour in the best condition for the baker’s use
is a problem which most of us do not give enough attention.
Flour should be kept in a dry, light and well ventilated
room. The temperature should be from 70 to 75
degrees F. and the flour should be so piled as to allow a free
circulation of pure air to every sack.</p>

<p>Light is a strong factor on the proper aging of flour for
baking purposes. Give the flour all the light you can. There
are a great many bakers who store their flour in a dark
basement. Some of these may be fairly well ventilated and
dry, but the flour receives no light. Darkness and dampness
go hand in hand. Flour requires light to give it the
best conditions for it to age.</p>

<p>Putting flour in a cold, damp cellar is like putting meat
in cold storage. The aging process is checked by the cold
and the flour remains as it was when first put in storage.
No aging process takes place. The flour has simply been
preserved in the same state as when placed in the cellar.</p>

<p>Possibly you have placed a handful of flour in a thin
layer in the bright sunlight for two or three hours, and then
compared it with the original flour. It has been bleached by
the sunlight, and if it were baked beside the same flour which
was not placed in the sunlight, you could hardly believe they
were the same flour.</p>

<p>Occasionally moving flour helps to age it; if it is turned
over once a week, or preferably more often, the aging process
is hastened.</p>

<p>Flour should always be sifted before using. In packing
in packages, flour is compressed and sifting loosens the small
particles and mixes air in the flour. There are machines on
the market specially adapted for this work. Besides being
sifters these machines have beaters, which throw the flour
and drive air into it. This aerating not only assists in aging
but has added value of giving it greater water absorbing
power, thus having the flour in much better condition for bread-making
process.</p>

<p>Under conditions of a well ventilated room, pure, dry air,
well lighted, and at temperature of 70-75 degrees F., flour
will probably be in the best condition to use in about ninety
days.</p>

<p>Many bakers do not have storage facilities for carrying
their flour ninety days. With this in mind, we stored flour at
a temperature of 84-86 degrees F. for thirty days. The results
received were very satisfactory. This manner of storing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
thirty days could be readily carried out by many bakers who
have not facilities for storing their flour for a longer time.
This would give much better results than the general storage
conditions which many bakers have now.</p>

<p>Where the flour storage is limited and no heated warehouse,
the space on the floor above the ovens can be used for
flour storage. The heat from the ovens keeps the flour
warm and insures a warm place to store flour. It is also
warmed quickly if it is necessary to use the flour immediately.
If the flour can be held for some time stored in such a manner
it ages quickly. It is necessary, however, to be sure no
flue gases come in contact with the flour, as these gases
quickly destroy the gluten. The above method has been
very successfully used in places where flour storage was
limited and no means of heating the flour was available.</p>

<p>During the aging of flour there is a slight loss of moisture,
which is utilized in two ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Part is absorbed by the air.</p>

<p>2. Part is used by the gluten in the aging process.</p></div>

<p>When water is added to aged flour in mixing dough, the
loss in moisture is more than made up by the larger percentage
of water it will absorb. Flour which is aged will on
the average absorb 5 per cent. more water than flour which
is freshly milled. The baking value of the flour is greatly
increased by proper aging. The gluten is much more elastic
and tough and makes a much better handling dough. The
flour is whiter in color, the fermentation period is more
easily handled, and it makes a much better loaf of bread in
general.</p>


<h3>Flour Mixing.</h3>

<p>Many bakers mix flour from different mills, thinking they
receive a more uniform and better blend of flour, that when
one flour is poor the other usually is good and helps it along.
In reality the opposite is the case.</p>

<p>Every mill has its own separate system of bolting flour,
so that they have the small particles of flour of the same
uniform size. The sizes of flour particles from different
mills will differ, consequently if these flours are blended, there
will be flour particles of varying sizes. When mixed into
dough, the smaller particles take up the water first and much
faster than the larger particles, and fermentation begins immediately
on the smaller particles. The larger particles require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
a longer time to take up the water, therefore the fermenting
dough is not uniform—the dough from the larger
particles being slower than that from the smaller particles.
Thus, part of the dough will be “too old” and the remainder
“too young.”</p>

<p>Some mills select their wheat and mill the flour by systematic
chemical and baking analyses, so that the gluten is
of uniform quality and gives the best results when it is handled
alone. If another flour is mixed with it, the gluten being
of a different character will make an inferior gluten of the
first flour and it will not give as good results as when handled
alone.</p>


<h3>Color of Flour.</h3>

<p>The progressive miller is a close student of the wheat
berry. It is necessary that he understand thoroughly the constitution
of wheat to obtain the best results in the flour he
grinds.</p>

<p>Milling in its simple form is merely the separation of the
bran coats and germ from the floury part of the kernel. To
make these separations as thorough as possible requires a
vast amount of machinery and a large number of operations.</p>

<p>The gluten of the wheat is not evenly distributed
throughout the berry. The central portion contains the least,
and it increases toward the outside. Starch, on the other
hand, is found to be just the reverse—the largest percentage
being found in the center and the percentage decreases
toward the outside. Some flours are made from the very
central portions. This gives a flour deficient in gluten and
excessive in starch, and will not stand the treatment given
it by the baker. It is starchy in color on account of the
excessive amount of starch and the small quantity of gluten.</p>

<p>An excessively white color and strong gluten are never
found together in the same flour. In studying the needs of
the baker in flour, we find he does not want an intensely
starchy, white color, as this flour will not give a corresponding
white color in the bread.</p>

<p>What the baker does want is a flour containing the
greatest strength and best color combined. It will be slightly
creamy in color, but when baked will make as white a loaf
as intensely white flour, and has the added advantage of having
larger water absorbing powers, and the power to withstand
the harsh treatment given it by the baker. The baker
in his mixing and fermentation develops the color in a loaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of bread. An intensely white flour will give a very dark loaf
of bread if not fermented properly. On the other hand, a
flour with good strength and creamy in color will, when
handled under proper conditions of fermentation, give as
white, if not whiter bread than the whiter flour. It also has
the added advantage of withstanding the vigorous treatment
of the machines. It gives a better volume, texture and pile
in the loaf, and if through accident there is any delay in
taking the dough when it is ready, the strong flour will stand
it, while the white flour will have to be taken at just the
right time to give good bread.</p>

<p>Color in bread is not necessarily obtained by using a
white flour. A better color can be obtained by using a strong
and slightly creamy flour handled properly in the fermentation.
The mixing of the dough at a high speed, and proper
fermentation at the correct temperature, are the factors which
make white bread.</p>


<h3>Mixing the Dough.</h3>

<p>To start a dough right is to mix it right. A properly
mixed dough should be mixed twenty minutes, in a single
arm machine, mixed with a speed of at least 36 revolutions
per minute. Some mix their doughs the same length of time
in mixers at a speed of 60 revolutions per minute. This gives
toughness to the dough and makes it take up more water.
There is one danger, and this is allowing the dough to warm
up too much. The mixed dough should be 80 degrees Fahr.
It is necessary to find the amount the mixer warms up the
dough in twenty minutes’ mixing, and allow for this in the
temperature of the water added. A dough properly mixed
should be tough enough to be pulled out like a rope without
breaking.</p>

<p>Too many bakers are running their doughs too hot. We
have had an exceptionally early spring—the change from
cold to warm weather was very sudden. The bakers have
not considered this and made the necessary changes, and
consequently the dough is mixed too warm.</p>

<p>Humidity plays a very strong part in the fermentation.
With a high humidity the dough works much faster than
with a low humidity. It is necessary to take this into consideration
in preparing the dough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>


<h3>Fermentation.</h3>

<p>Probably the most important step in bread-making is
the fermentation period. To start the fermentation correctly
means to have the dough mixed correctly as to temperature
and ingredients added, to obtain the best results in
fermentation.</p>

<p>Yeast ferments best at a temperature of 86 degrees.
But, if a dough is set at this temperature, and has a tendency
to warm up during fermentation, it gives even a higher temperature
when the dough is ready for the pans. Other ferments
also start to develop at this temperature which cause
the dough to become sour, to a more or less degree, and in
this way either cause sour bread or at least a loss of the rich
wheat flavor.</p>

<p>A dough works best at a temperature of 80 degrees Fahr.,
having the room at 76 degrees Fahr. The danger points in
the temperature of a dough under these conditions are 76
degrees and 86 degrees Fahr. If a dough is mixed at 80 degrees
Fahr. and put into a dough room having a temperature
of 76 degrees Fahr., it will probably go onto the bench at
82 degrees Fahr., which gives the best results in the bread. If
a dough is mixed warmer than 80 degrees Fahr. it is necessary
to watch it much closer and take it at exactly the right
time. Even with the most careful observation of a dough
at a warm temperature, a loss of flavor or a tinge of sourness
develops. Our advice is to be wary of a warm dough.</p>

<p>The age of dough is the critical point in bread-making.
How to tell the age of a dough is a question we have never
seen satisfactorily answered. Most bakers tell intuitively,
and this has required long experience. The color, texture,
volume and flavor of the resulting bread are dependent almost
entirely on the age of the dough.</p>

<p>The length of time of the first rising in a straight dough
is a point many bakers do not consider. If the dough is too
young, give more time on the first rising; if too old, shorten
the time of the first rising. The age of a dough is governed
to a considerable degree by the first rising.</p>

<p>A strong flour requires three risings by the ordinary
methods of bread-making. There are processes used where
the dough is punched at stated intervals. This, however, is
used more successfully where very good control is had over
the temperature and humidity.</p>

<p>Technically, a dough is ready when the yeast has reached
the maximum of its energy. If the proper development of
gluten and the maximum of energy of the yeast is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
reached, a young dough is the result. A young dough will
not spring in the oven, the texture will be coarse, the color
will be yellow in varying degrees, and a generally poor loaf
is received.</p>

<p>If the fermentation is carried too far, the yeast will have
lost its vitality, other ferments will have started to develop.
The loaf will have a tendency to fall in the oven. It will
not spring in the oven, the texture will be coarse, the
color dark and the wheat flavor lost, a sour odor will also be
noticeable.</p>

<p>If the dough is fermented at too high a temperature,
both young and old characteristics will be noticeable in the
loaf.</p>

<p>Any improper handling of a dough, either by ingredients
added, length of the period of fermentation, or wrong temperature,
will give a dark, coarse and small loaf. The miller
is usually blamed for these results, which in reality are not
caused by the flour, but by the improper use of the ingredients
and methods of handling.</p>


<h3>Ingredients.</h3>

<p>The ingredients in bread-making that have a vital influence
upon the finished bread, are: Flour, water, yeast,
salt. It is always necessary to have these. Other ingredients
act in the capacity of hastening fermentation, yeast foods,
flavor, etc., to give a character or special flavor to bread.</p>

<p>We contend there is no bread recipe. What we call a
bread recipe is merely a combination of ingredients in proportions
to suit the conditions under which the baker is
working. We all have books full of bread recipes, each a
little different from the other, and all striving to obtain the
same bread, or give their bread a slightly different character.</p>

<p>One baker finds his conditions are suitable for one combination
of ingredients; another finds he cannot use this
recipe at all. He finds another combination which suits his
conditions. All are working under different conditions of
climate, temperature and manner of handling. Consequently,
it is necessary to find the proportion of ingredients which
best adapt themselves to the present conditions. The character
of bread desired naturally influences the ingredients used,
and as conditions change the ingredients must change to meet
these conditions, if a special character and individuality in
bread is desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>


<h3>Water.</h3>

<p>Most bakers do not use as much water as is possible in
bread-making. A hard, northwestern flour requires a slack
dough if the flour has been made from wheats having the
right characters and properly milled. The best results are obtained
by setting the dough as soft as can be handled. When
mixing the dough the water at first is not thoroughly absorbed
by the flour particles, as the gluten is so hard it takes
some time for these particles to thoroughly absorb all the
water they will hold. This continuing to absorb is known
to the baker as “tightening up.” This feature is characteristic
of Northwestern flours, and is lacking in other flours. When
mixing a dough from Northwestern flours always allow for
“tightening up,” and mix the dough softer than it is intended
to be when you “take the dough.” The opposite is the case
in softer flours as they “slack off.”</p>

<p>Any flour will lose this characteristic of “tightening up”
if a dough when mixed is too hot. Gluten is in reality a vegetable
glue and softens when the dough is mixed warm, and
consequently will not absorb the amount of water it should,
and it will have a tendency to “slack off” instead of “tightening
up.”</p>

<h2>MILK VALUE IN BREAD<br />

<span class="subtitle">BY W. E. BREEZE, OF LONDON</span></h2>


<p>Of course, we all know that wheat grown under certain
conditions varies, and, as the climate and soil differ, so does
the gluten, as is exampled between comparison with a soft
and a strong flour. In the same way it applies to milk. The
composition of fat in new milk is determined by the breed,
climate, food and health of the cow. A really rich milk
would produce as much as ¾ ounce to 1 ounce of fat to
the pint, especially just now, when the animals are kept up
and fed pretty well. They give less milk, but it is much
higher in quality. In summer, when there is plenty of grass,
the cows give more milk, and, on the whole, more fat, but the
percentage is not so high as it is just now. In Holland, for
instance, milk is poor, and more deficient in fat, because the
pastures are more moist and watery. Whether the various fancy
brown breads do or do not carry out, as they are reputed to
do, all the properties accorded to them I am not prepared to
say. Time must be given for a suitable trial, and if they are
are not found suitable we must turn our attention to something
else. A milk loaf of a favorable quality is generally
being inquired for, but I am sorry to have to record that the
majority of bakers do not treat it with the same respect that
they accord to its rivals. Its rivals are sold under certain
conditions. You must not adulterate it in any sense, for if
you do you are liable to prosecution. But the old milk bread
is not standardized as to its composition, and there is hardly
a bread-maker who does not sell “milk bread.” I may also
safely venture to say that the milk added to the bread is as
varied in quantity as there are purveyors of the commodity.
There is no stipulated or understood quantity, and in consequence
the quality of the loaf suffers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>During my experience I have known and seen bread sold
as “milk bread” which had never seen the sight of milk, but,
on the other hand, there are other bakers who are most particular
and have the most liberal quantity of milk, the result
being they produce a beautiful and most honest loaf. I have
seen other bakers who put in about six quarts of milk, and
the bread is made up in fancy shapes and weights, and styled
fancy bread. There is no recognized standard for the quantity
of milk used per sack. Whether it is of sufficient importance
to the trade that such a loaf should be made and sold
is another matter. But I wish to put before you the value
of milk in bread-making, and also to emphasize the benefits
which, in my opinion, are derived from bread made with the
addition of milk. I have eaten brown bread which has set
up irritation in the stomach, but this has never happened to
my knowledge when the bread has been made with good
sweet full cream milk. I am convinced if this milk bread
were kept before the public, made, of course, from the proper
ingredients and in proper proportion, there would be no
doubt as to the best loaf to be obtained at fancy prices, a
loaf which would leave the baker an equal, if not better,
profit than we obtain to-day for our fancy browns. In 1908,
at the London Exhibition, for the first time, a milk powdered
loaf won the first prize in the milk bread competition, and
thus beat the new milk itself. That bread looked very nice,
and its color was excellent, the weight sent in being about 2
pounds. It is true there is no recognized standard shape for
milk bread, so several shapes were sent in, the competitors
seeming to satisfy themselves to produce an ordinary loaf
with milk in it. I do not know whether it would be possible
for the manufacturers to suggest lines upon which shape and
quality could be combined to produce a standard milk loaf. I
do not know whether I am asking too much, but in time it would
not amount to anything more than asking for a cottage
loaf, a crumby or tin loaf. If manipulated and produced
properly, it would increase it dietetic value, and be a different
commodity, with changed properties, and yielding nourishment
in a new and concentrated form.</p>


<h3>Dry Milk.</h3>

<p>I do not say that the combination I have spoken of is a
correct one or not, but I do not think it should beat the use
of full cream milk, for I have always noticed a distinctive
delicate flavor with the new milk in comparison with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
dried article, and I did not intend to treat of dried or condensed
milk, but only of new milk, skimmed milk and separated
milk. To make my subject more complete, I will, after
all, first touch upon dried milk. This is a very useful and
unvarying commodity. It is fairly quick in solution in warm
water, and is convenient, especially in cases where really good
dairy milk is scarce or unobtainable. Its fat and sugar are
more or less varied, or practically nil, and as dried milk is
minus lactic acid, the flavor being sometimes interfered with
by evaporation, I cannot recommend it in preference to good
new milk. Of course, with a little doctoring, you may improve
some faults, but the delicate flavor of new milk is not
so pronounced.</p>


<h3>Condensed Milk.</h3>

<p>I will now pass on to condensed milk. Sweetened condensed
milk is a most desirable substance from an economic
and handy point of view. It may be used in water alone or
in conjunction with separated milk. Of course, you use it
for what it is worth. If used separately, milk fat, or some
other fat, such as good sweet lard or neutral fat, will have to
be used to make up the deficiency, the usual quantity being
about one small tin and 3 ounces of fat per gallon of water.</p>


<h3>Buttermilk.</h3>

<p>We will now pass on to buttermilk, which you all know
is very useful in the manufacture of soda and powdered
goods, as the lactic acid already formed has the property of
softening the gluten in the flour, thereby rendering the goods
soft and mellow. As, however, I am concerned with bread-making,
we will leave the powdered goods alone. I have
had some very good results from condensed milk by keeping
it active, and not allowing it to lag. It seems to have a
bleaching effect, and from a nutritive point of view comes
very near to new milk. Again, the proteids of the milk and
mineral matter are practically digested by the action of the
lactic organisms, and new milk undergoes no change during
fermentation in the dough. The changed condition in the
buttermilk is of great advantage, and lactic acid adds flavor
to bread made with compressed yeast. There is no reason
to suppose that bread made with buttermilk will go sour
sooner than that made with fresh milk if the fermentation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
managed properly. To use buttermilk in bread-making the
milk must be fresh—not more than twenty-four hours old.
Old milk will not do, and when fermentation is started the
dough must be attended to and baked in a good oven. Of
course, I am not going to advise a novice to use buttermilk,
or he would most probably be doomed to failure, but I have
indicated the possibilities of the use of buttermilk. I will
give you an analysis of buttermilk and also of new milk.
New milk contains 4.0 per cent of fat, 3.6 of proteids, 4.5 milk
sugar, 9.7 of ash or mineral matter, 87.2 per cent. of lactic
acid. Buttermilk has the following proportions: Fat 0.8,
proteids 3.7, milk sugar 3.8, ash or mineral matter 0.7, H<sub>2</sub>O
90.85, lactic acid 0.85. The production of lactic acid is limited
to the proportion of milk sugar present. I have not
made large quantities of bread with buttermilk, but have
treated certain quantities as a hobby to try what I could
really do with it, and the results were quite satisfactory.</p>


<h3>Skimmed Milk.</h3>

<p>Now we will consider skimmed milk, or separated milk.
We must bear in mind they have very little fat, though the
milk sugar is retained; it is simply fresh milk minus the
cream. As butter-fat is about 4 per cent. of the total milk,
often less, the fat can be replaced by lard or any neutral fat.
They are really as good, and the public in any case will
hardly give you credit for having used butter. A quart of
separated milk, containing 2 ounces of sweet lard or neutral
fat, will make nearly as good bread as fresh milk. Do not
get the idea that it will be thinner, and therefore use more
fat than is necessary. One gallon of separated milk and 7
ounces of fat equals one gallon of fresh milk. Lard and neutral
fats only affect the texture and shortness, and even butter
added as a fat does not give that mild flavor imparted
when the full cream is used.</p>


<h3>New Milk.</h3>

<p>I will deal lastly with new milk, and its advantages in
comparison with the last named. The composition of new
milk consists of 87 per cent. of water, 5 of milk sugar, 4 of
fat, and about 3½ of albuminoids, the rest being mineral
matter. The effect of added milk to bread in place of water
is, other things being equal, to increase its nutriment. Providing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the bread is worked on a short and quick system, as
it should be, it will get a bloom, with a rich crumb, color and
even texture. The crust will be thin and fine, and the flavor
will be most appetizing. Although the table just given is
the average composition of milk, there are variations. The
casein and albumin are the nitrogenous constituents of the
milk, and may be regarded as flesh-formers. The fat consists
of stearine, and other constituents which give to butter
its characteristic flavor. Milk sugar or lactose is the only
carbohydrate present in starch. The ash consists chiefly of
phosphates of lime and potash. Taking the figures given, it
can be said that new milk has from three to four times the
value of separated milk, and, taking a careful valuation, we
get, say, 1s. per gallon of new milk and 3d. for separated.
Of course, where large quantities of new milk are bought
there would be a corresponding reduction in the price. I
get it by the ten gallons; there is no transit to pay, and no
second handling is required, the milk coming direct from the
farm to the bake-house. The excessive fat per gallon in new
milk is worth 9d. per gallon above separated milk, which
would cost 3d. The value of a standard sample would be as
follows: New milk—Fat 3.5, non-fat 9.0, total solids 2.5. Separated
milk—Fat 0.3, non-fats 9.0, total 9.3, value 3d. Taking
as a maximum quantity eight gallons of new milk per sack,
and as a minimum quantity six gallons, the price of the loaf
would be higher. To assist in cases where a large quantity
of milk is used the dough must be softer because of the binding
effect of the milk. Taking into account the added solids,
we should have a larger output per sack, together with a better
loaf, one of high dietetic value, while the milk and butter
contained in it would improve the flavor, texture, color and
physical properties of the crumb. Evenness of texture and
cleverness of loaf make a better crumb color, the effect most
noticeable with added milk, being due to the percentage of
fat present. As a comparison, take 1 ounce of butter with 10
pounds of flour, as against 1 quart of milk. The butter or
fat gives a very fine texture and thin crust, whilst the milk
results in a better bloom, owing to the unfermentable sugar
of milk. Of all milks, fresh full cream is best, and ought to
be used with water in equal proportions, as half milk and half
water give excellent results.</p>


<h3>Miscellaneous.</h3>

<p>A good idea followed by many is weighing the ingredients
required for as many custard pies used in a week or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
two. For instance, if you make 4 pies a day, or 24 a week,
weigh the required amount of sugar, starch, salt and mace,
mix and sift together and put away in a can or box, and
every time you make 4 pies weigh off one pound, or four
ounces to each pie. This saves time in weighing, and does
away with the guessing of the salt and flavor, which is hard
in small mixes. The same is done with pumpkin pies, adding
to the whole amount the required spices. This enables you
to make a uniformly spiced and tasting pumpkin pie, which
is the most important feature of it.</p>


<h3>Recipe for Preserving Rhubarb for Pie.</h3>

<p>The following is a recipe for preserving rhubarb for
pie purposes, and it is simple and cheap. Take the rhubarb
and cut it in pieces, and put it in fruit jars, filling them with
water, and thereby keeping it all winter, or as long as you
want it, and when you get ready to use it, it is all ready
for use, after sugar, etc., is added.</p>

<h2>Bacterial Contamination in
Bread</h2>


<p>James Grant, an English chemist and teacher of the bakery
classes in the Manchester Bakery School, in England,
gave the following illustrated lecture before the Bakery
Students’ Society, on the Bacterial Contamination of Bread,
which is of considerable interest to American bakers:</p>

<p>It is well known that wheats and other cereals, owing
to the deep crease or furrow down the center of the ventral
side, and to the hairs (especially in the case of wheat), known
as the beard, at the top of the berry, are liable to cause bacterial
diseases in our food supplies. It may be objected that
washing during the preparation for milling will get rid of
dust and its accompanying bacteria. Unfortunately, this is
not the case, as may readily be shown by washing wheats
that are ready for milling and incubating the washing water.
Fruits, equally with cereals, are liable to this contamination.
Wines, for example, for hundreds of years have been fermented
by the yeasts which adhere to the grape in the
“bloom” on the outside of the fruit. Hansen, the great expert
on yeasts, has proved that during the period of the year
when there are no grapes, the yeasts and other micro-organisms
that exist in the soil in the form of spores, which are
able to endure periods of stress that kill the adult micro-organisms.
Similarly in the case of barley. We have found
in our work, time after time, that germs of all kinds exist
on the wrinkled surface of the grain. Not many years ago
we were able to isolate pure cultures of the bacillus which
induces tetanus or lockjaw. During the milling process it
can be seen that germs left on the surface of the berry must
necessarily pass into the finished flour. Flour, then, is not
germ free.</p>

<p>It is claimed by certain millers, who bleach their flours,
that one of the chief objects is to render it sterile or nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
so. Research has shown that this claim is justified only to a
very limited extent. In the year 1904, Dr. F. M. Blumenthal
studied the subject very thoroughly. Two of his results, as
examples, will be quoted. In an unbleached rye meal there
existed no less than 2,400 micro-organisms per gramme of the
meal. After bleaching there still remained 1,600 micro-organisms
per gramme. With flour unbleached he found 540 organisms
per grain, and with bleached flour 170. In both
cases the best figures are only given. It is pretty evident,
then, that milled products are not germ free; and further,
those spoken of as meals, or in other words, those that contain
the husk, are much more contaminated than those from
which the husk has been separated, e. g., the ordinary flour.</p>

<p>The chief object of this paper is to give students an idea
as to the best methods of undertaking a research or investigation
into the cause of contamination. Since taking up the
study of bread-making, between five and six years ago, a number
of very interesting cases of bacterial diseases of bread
have come under my observation, but the one that impressed
me more deeply than others was that of a case of bread baked
in special tins at a very low temperature, and known in the
trade as sandwich bread. For this purpose the bread must
be cooked at the lowest possible temperature, so as to form
little or no crust. In this particular case of sandwich bread,
after a few days keeping, a peculiar formation, resulting in
a hole, was developed in the center of the loaf and running
in the direction of the length. Accompanying this development
was a very unpleasant odor. All around the low flat
hole the crumb had a dull, sodden appearance. The question
to be settled was: What was the cause of this unpleasant
formation? To one acquainted with the life history of very
many of the lower forms of life, especially of vegetable life,
there was little difficulty in ascribing it to filth bacteria.
From the general appearance of a section of a loaf the only
conclusion that could be arrived at was that the trouble
was due to bacterial action, together with the products
formed. Starting from these premises it became necessary
to inquire into the sources of such contamination. These
might be due to either (1) Dirty and unclean premises and
plant, or (2) to the water used, or (3) to the yeast, or (4)
to the flours, or (5) to bread improvers used (if any). It
could not possibly be the salt, because salt is so strong an
antiseptic that there could be no risk from this source. Numbers
(1), (2) and (5) were easily eliminated. This narrowed
down the work to a study of the flours and yeast. The details
of the research will show the means taken to determine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
if possible, the actual causes of the trouble. The work
was still further narrowed down by the fact that if bacteria
were at work it could only be a group capable of withstanding
comparatively high temperatures. Again, a large number
of expensive media were unnecessary, as bread was a suitable
food for our purpose. The requisite appliances were
those of an ordinary well-filled bacteriological laboratory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ordinary microscopic slides of the diseased bread were
made with sterile water, and these examined by microscope.
This revealed the presence of moulds and mucor spores,
yeasts—both the ordinary cultivated and wild—and numerous
bacteria. On further examination after incubation at
suitable temperatures, most of the above-mentioned proved
to be just the common micro-organisms existing in flours
and bread. Some of the bread was then incubated at 80
degrees Fahrenheit for four days. The piece of bread was
then found to be covered with a whitish-colored growth,
which later developed into a dark yeasty color and possessed
a very peculiar and strong odor. Samples of the flour and
yeast used in the manufacture of the bread were treated in
a similar manner. In four days the flour specimens showed
the same peculiar growth which, in two days, changed to
the dark fawn color possessing the same characteristic odor.
The yeast, on the other hand, behaved quite normally and
developed none of the strange symptoms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next step was to try to infect some sterile bread
with this peculiar disease, if possible. To this end sterile
bread was introduced into Petri dishes, moistened with sterile
water, and some of the dish contents sprinkled with flour,
and others with crumbs of the diseased bread. The incubation
temperatures were 68 and 80 degrees Fahr., respectively.
At the lower temperature, as well as at the higher, the cultures
were all successful, but it took several days longer in the
specimens—at the lower temperature. Various other cultures
were now put on, with other media and different apparatus,
with a view to isolating the special cause of the disease.
All specimens, and also micro-slides from these, had
to be examined regularly at fixed periods, entailing, of
course, an enormous amount of detail work which cannot
here be set forth. Suffice it to say that ultimately by varying
the media and mode of cultivation swarms of very
minute oval-shaped non-mobile bacteria, and also many rod-shaped
mobile organisms, were isolated. By this time all
yeasts, moulds, mucors, and other complex growing organisms
had been eliminated. To ensure that all the apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and media were sterile, blank specimens were put on so as
to be parallel with the special culture in each case.</p>

<p>By means of the plate (Petri dish) cultures and Bottcher
moist cells, a group of minute bacteria belonging to the
Thermo or film species was obtained by which this particular
disease could be produced at will. Moreover, prepared in
this way, the bacteria which cause the disease were, and still
are, very virulent. It only remained now to identify the
particular species of the Thermo-group, but this was not an
easy matter, as the members of the Thermo group are exceedingly
minute. The plate cultures yielded colonies which
rapidly increased in size, the disease spreading over the
media in all directions. It was finally identified as belonging
to the Proteus division of the Thermo or septic bacteria.
These exist in most fertile soils, hence the research showed
that the flour was produced from near the outer skin of the
wheat berry, or, in other words, a low grade of flour. Further,
it proves that the miller, with all his modern machinery,
has not yet perfected that portion which does the cleansing
or washing of the wheat. It should be remembered that
the complete washing of the wheat, so as to free it from
dust and micro-organisms, especially in the deep crease, and
the fine hairs or beard at the top of the berry, is not at all
a simple matter; but much more could be done, even if
only a very dilute antiseptic was used in the final or next
to the last washing water, instead of finishing with the
muddy fluid as at present.</p>

<h2>BAKERY ACCOUNTING<br />

<span class="subtitle">BY WM. W. ALLAN</span></h2>


<p>Next to the baking business itself, the most important
item is that of an accounting system.</p>


<h3>Checking Drivers</h3>

<p>The first step in this direction is the making up of a list
of the various kinds of bread wanted by each driver, showing
in total the number of loaves of each brand ordered in
the total column. In another column under heading “Total
Made” have the foreman enter the number of loaves of each
kind made. If a shipping business is conducted the amount
of bread needed can also be shown on this sheet under heading
“Shipping.” If a retail store is conducted in connection
with the bakery the amount needed for store may also be
shown on this sheet under heading “Store.” This completes
the Bread Order. (See <a href="#FIGURE_A">Fig. “A.”</a>)</p>

<h3>Bread Department.</h3>

<p>A Bread Department account should be kept in the
ledger, and credit to this account should be made for drivers,
shipping and store sales, and if bread is sold on the basis of
four cents per loaf the total credit to this account divided
by four will give the total number of loaves approximately
sold for a month or any given period, which figures may
be used in arriving at the cost of production per 1,000 loaves
for any item of expense, such as bakers’ salaries, fuel, merchandise,
etc., etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the month charge to the bread department
all items of expense for that month, such as advertising,
salaries, sundry expenses, light and fuel, merchandise, stable
expense, and the monthly proportion of insurance and
taxes—the balance will show the profit or loss in this department
for such period.</p>


<h3>Shipping Department.</h3>

<p>If a shipping business is conducted, a shipping department
account should also be kept, and to this account can
be charged all bread shipped at the rate of, say three cents
per loaf—crediting same to bread department. Charge should
be made to this account for all express charges and for its
proportion of salaries. The credit to this account will be
the gross charges to the parties to whom bread is shipped.
The difference will show the profit or loss.</p>

<p>My experience has been that if the proper charges are
made for all expenses in connection with shipping, including
losses owing to bad account, the wear and tear and loss of
baskets—the shipping department will invariably show an
actual loss, even on the basis of charging only three cents
per loaf for all bread used in shipping, unless bread returned
by the drivers is used in shipping, and which is used for this
purpose by some bakers, and which otherwise would have to
be disposed of for considerably less.</p>


<h3>Cake Department.</h3>

<p>Where cakes, pies, cookies, etc., are made in connection
with bread they should be separated from the bread department
and all could be included in one department called
Cake Department, or any other name suitable. The materials
used for the making of these goods should be charged direct
to this account when purchased, and all materials used from
the bread department merchandise should be charged to
Cake Department merchandise and credited to Bread Department
merchandise. Also charge to Cake Department its
proportion of bakers’ salaries, light and fuel, and other expenses
belonging to this account. The credit to this account
will be the drivers’ returns from the sale of pies, cakes, etc.,
and for those sold to the store or shipping customers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>


<h3>Store Department.</h3>

<p>If a retail store in conducted in connection with a bakery,
all goods taken from the shop should be charged to Store
Account at the regular wholesale prices, and credited to the
bread or cake department. Charge should also be made to
Store Account for clerk salary attending store, and should
also be charged for its proportion of light and fuel, office
salary, and other expenses, and also for all merchandise purchased
from the outside to be sold in the store. The credit
to this account will be the daily sales as shown by the cash
register.</p>


<h3>Stable Feed.</h3>

<p>A stable feed account should be kept to which is charged
all items of hay, grain, etc., used for horse feed. At the end
of the month the balance of this account can be charged into
Stable Expense Account. The object in keeping this account
separate is for the purpose of arriving at the cost for feeding
a horse for a given period, which can be done by dividing the
number of horses into the total charges to this account.</p>


<h3>Stable Expense.</h3>

<p>Charge to this account items of medicines, veterinary
bills, shoeing bills and stable man’s wages, and all other items
of expense belonging to this account. At the end of the
month charge the balance in Stable Feed Account to this
account, which will then show the entire cost of operating
the stable.</p>


<h3>General Accounts</h3>

<p>Ledger accounts should also be kept of Buildings, Harness,
Horses, Machinery, Fixtures, Ovens and Wagons, and
a certain amount should be credited at the end of each month
to each of these accounts to cover shrinkage, the total
amount of these shrinkages being charged to Expense Account.
Ledger accounts should also be kept of Insurance and
Taxes, charging all bills for these items to these accounts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and crediting these accounts at the end of each month with
their monthly pro ratio for these items, charging at the same
time this pro ratio to Expense.</p>


<h3>Inventory.</h3>

<p>To install an accounting system as described above, which
is on a monthly basis, it will, of course, be necessary to take
monthly inventories of Fuel and Merchandise for each department,
Stable Feed and Store Stock.</p>

<p>A system such as I have outlined is adequate for handling
the accounting end of a baking business having an output up
to eight or ten thousand loaves daily, but for a larger baking
business a more intricate system would of necessity have to
be installed and which would carry with it a great many more
accounts than I have named.</p>

<p>A great many minor record accounts could be kept in
connection with the above system, but it would be quite difficult
to explain all these.</p>


<h3>Breaking an Egg with One Hand.</h3>

<p>The trick of breaking an egg with one hand is something
that you should learn how to do. It not only gives you
speed, but shows that you are a workman thoroughly familiar
with your business. The trick can be acquired with a little
practice. To do it nicely the hand should be a little moist.
Hold the egg in the right hand between the forefinger and
the second finger with the thumb on top. Strike the egg
once sharply on the rim of the glass to crack the shell, then
holding it over the glass press down slightly with the thumb
and the egg drops out, leaving the shell in the hand. While
learning to do this the glass should be allowed to stand on
the counter, so that if you fail, the left hand can come to the
assistance of the right; but just as soon as you know that
you can break the egg with one hand, then you can hold the
glass in the other. This saves time, especially when you have
two or three to prepare at once. When you have become
proficient with the right hand try the left until you, can use
either or both.</p>

<h2>PRACTICAL FLOUR TESTS</h2>


<h3>Color and Texture.</h3>

<p>The color of bread made from wheat flour varies with
the kind of wheat used in making the flour and also with the
grade of flour used in making the bread. All wheats contain
minute quantities of a yellow coloring matter, consequently
a fresh, well-milled unbleached patent flour has a
live, bright, yellow tint. This yellow tint disappears when a
flour is aged or artificially bleached and the flour becomes
almost snow white. The lower grades of flour have, in addition
to the yellow color, a dark color, due to foreign matter
and bran particles. This color does not improve much with
age, nor is it possible to improve it by bleaching.</p>

<p>Bread usually appears whiter than the flour from which
it is made. This is due to aeration, i. e., mixing air and gases
thoroughly through the dough in kneading and fermentation.
Very little bleaching really occurs during fermentation, in
fact fermentation changes some of the starch which is snow
white into dextrin, which is a yellow substance. The whitening
effect of aeration, however, overcomes the yellow color
due to chemical change and causes the bread to appear
whiter than the flour.</p>

<p>In comparing colors of bread in comparative baking
tests, there is no better method than allowing the loaves to
cool, cutting a slice from each, placing side by side, and
using your judgment as to the value of each color in comparison
to standard loaf. In comparing a number of loaves
by this method the colors will range through tints of white,
yellow, gray and blue. Taking pure white as 100 per cent.
the other tints in order of their value, are yellow, blue and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
gray, but it sometimes becomes a question of judgment of
the observer which of the colors is the brightest and most
clean and of most value.</p>

<p>The texture of bread is caused by the expansion of the
dough by the carbon dioxide which tends to escape but is
held in and gathers in small quantities through the dough.
When bread is baked the dough retains a permanent shape
and the cavities in which the gas gathered give the bread a
porous appearance. These holes vary in size and shape. A
flour with a good quality of gluten holds the gas in small
globules and therefore the holes are small and usually elongated
from bottom to top of the loaf. This is good texture
and when touched gives a sensation of touching velvet. A
poor gluten allows the gas to gather into large, round
globules and produces a coarser texture and one which is
harsh to the touch. Too long a period of fermentation or
too much water in the dough will also produce poor texture.
As in color, value of texture depends on the judgment of the
observer.</p>
